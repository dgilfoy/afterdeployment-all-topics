external or internal signals.&nbsp; These internal or external “signals” that promote stress are called “stressors”.&nbsp; Your body and brain go into “alert” mode when responding to stressors.&nbsp; You naturally react to a danger threat, whether the threat is real or not.&nbsp; You react by physically and mentally preparing to fight or run (take flight) from the threat.&nbsp; This reaction is known as “fight or flight”.<br><br><strong>1.2 Effects of Stress on Performance</strong></p><p>While deployed, you had to stay “on guard” most of the time.&nbsp; Your safety, your life, and the lives of others depended on it.&nbsp; Returning from deployment, you may continue to feel “amped-up” or think you need to stay “on guard” to be safe.<br><br>The increased stress that helps you respond to threats during deployment can prevent you from coping with stressors in daily life.&nbsp; When your body is under too much stress, you’re more likely to:</p><ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Miss

The bus gets stuck in traffic because of road construction.</li>\n        <li><u>Beliefs</u>: As you take in the situation, you begin to form beliefs about the event. Your beliefs determine whether you see this as a minor inconvenience or a major problem.</li>\n        <li><u>Consequences</u>: The consequence of your beliefs is that you feel stressed OR relaxed for the rest of the ride, depending on what your beliefs tell you.</li>\n        </ul><p><br><u>Negative Beliefs about the event</u></p>\n        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>This will take forever.&nbsp; I’ll never get home.</li>\n        <li>Why does this always happen to me?</li>\n        <li>They always do construction at the worst times.</li>\n        </ul><p><u>Positive Beliefs about the event</u></p>\n        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>I’ll just be a few minutes late.</li>\n        <li>I’m going to listen to some music while I wait.</li>\n        <li>I’m glad they are fixing the road</li>\n        </ul><p><br><u>Step 3: Negative Thought Patterns</u></p>\n        <p>The third step in mental reframing is to recognize when your beliefs about an event or situation are unhelpful or negative.&nbsp; The following are examples of negative thought patterns that can increase stress levels:</p>\n        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><u>All or Nothing</u>: You tend to experience things in black and white terms.&nbsp; You see situations as either entirely “<em>good</em>” or “<em>bad</em>”, when there is clearly a middle ground.&nbsp; An example of all-or-nothing thinking is that <strong><em>either</em></strong> you are perfect <strong><em>or </em></strong>you’re a failure.</li>\n        <li><u>Exaggeration</u>: Sometimes exaggeration is also called “catastrophizing”.&nbsp; This thinking pattern involves blowing the imagined consequences of an event out of proportion.&nbsp; You may see minor problems as being “horrible” or “disastrous”.&nbsp; Others may say “you’re making a mountain out of a molehill”.&nbsp; Sometimes it is hard to pinpoint your trigger.&nbsp; If you can’t identify it, don’t worry.&nbsp; Work on relaxing and calming yourself.</li>\n        <li><u>Overgeneralization</u>: &nbsp;You take an isolated experience or piece of information and draw the wrong conclusions.&nbsp; You see isolated negative events as a never-ending pattern of negative events or defeat.&nbsp; For example, if someone turns you down for a date, you conclude that you are <em>always</em> rejected or that you will <em>never</em> find the right person.&nbsp; Look for words such as <strong>always</strong> or <strong>never </strong>in your self-talk as signs that you are over generalizing.</li>\n        <li><u>Mind-reading</u>: You assume you know what another person is thinking, even though you have no evidence to back up your assumptions.&nbsp; When you mind-read, you almost always assume that someone is thinking the worst about you.&nbsp; For example, you might think your friends don’t want to hear about your deployment experiences.&nbsp; In reality, your friends want to know what happened but feel awkward asking you questions.&nbsp; Look for phrases like <strong>he/ she probably thinks</strong>...or <strong>they don’t understand</strong>… in your self-talk as signs that you are mind-reading.</li>\n        </ul><p><br><u>Step 4: Challenging Your Thoughts</u></p>\n        <p>The fourth step in mental reframing is to challenge your negative thinking patterns and self-talk.&nbsp; This takes a lot of practice and patience because self-talk is a reflection of your core beliefs about yourself, others, and the world.</p>\n        <p>Look carefully for evidence that challenges negative or stressful self-talk.&nbsp; In order to challenge your negative thinking, you can ask yourself the following questions:</p>\n        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Is there evidence for or against my stressful thought or belief?</li>\n        <li>Am I thinking in all-or-nothing terms?</li>\n        <li>Am I using words or phrases such as disastrous, horrible, and awful?</li>\n        <li>Am I making sweeping generalizations based on a single event?</li>\n        <li>Am I using words like always and never in my self-talk?</li>\n        <li>Am I judging what other people think, when I really don’t know what they think?</li>\n        <li>Is my information source reliable?</li>\n        <li>Are my beliefs based on feelings rather than facts?</li>\n        </ul><p><br><u>Step 5: Using Positive Self-talk</u></p>\n        <p>The final step in mental reframing is to replace negative, stressful self-talk with positive, empowering self-talk.&nbsp; You may be surprised at how changing your outlook on stressful situations or events can change your life.&nbsp; Every situation presents opportunities to learn and grow.&nbsp; The more you focus on the positive aspects of the situation, the more control you have over your stress reactions.<br><br><strong>3.5 Stress Journal</strong></p>\n        <p>Keeping a stress journal helps you realize when you’re having a stress response.&nbsp; The earlier you identify your stress reactions, the sooner you can do something about them.&nbsp; Every time you feel stressed, stop and look closely at your situation.&nbsp; Then enter the following information into your stress journal.&nbsp;</p>\n        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Where was I?</li>\n        <li>What was going on around me?</li>\n        <li>Who was I with?</li>\n        <li>How could I have used more positive thinking and realistic self-talk to handle stress?</li>\n        <li>Could I identify a negative thinking pattern?

We <strong>DO</strong> have some control over the causes of stress in our lives.</p>\n        <p><em><u>Some stressors can be eliminated or diminished easily. </u></em></p>\n        <p><u>Example</u>: Milo has had a nagging toothache for a few weeks that is contributing to his stress and irritability.&nbsp; But he can choose to go to a dentist and take care of the problem.</p>\n        <p><em><u>Some stressors can be controlled but the effort we have to expend is much greater.</u></em></p>\n        <p><u>Example</u>: Maria needs to pass a course to get into mechanics training.&nbsp; She finds mechanics training difficult and is stressed that she won’t pass the course.&nbsp; But she can control her stress by studying more in her free time.</p>\n        <p><em><u>Some stressful situations are simply out of our control.</u></em></p>\n        <p><u>Example</u>: Lisa just found out she may have a serious illness.&nbsp;

He couldn’t wait to go home to his wife and son,&nbsp;but now that he is home, he feels anxious and irritable every night as he drives home from base.</em></p>\n        <p><strong>STEP 2: </strong>Define the Problem</p>\n        <p>Find the real problem and be specific about how it triggers your stress reaction.&nbsp;</p>\n        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max asks himself: “What is it about going home that makes me feel stressed?”&nbsp; He realizes his stress is related to his son’s poor performance at school and bad attitude at home.</em></p>\n        <p><strong>STEP 3: </strong>Set a Goal</p>\n        <p>Try to set a goal for how to respond in a way that reduces stress.</p>\n        <p><em>Max knows he can’t control how other people act and that he can’t turn Max Jr. into a “perfect” son. But, as a father, Max does have some influence over his son.&nbsp; He decides to set specific, manageable goals, such as getting Max Jr. to spend more time on homework and help more around the house. Wait to go home to his wife and son, but now that he is home, he feels anxious and irritable every night as he drives home from base.</em></p>\n        <p>&nbsp;<strong>STEP 4: </strong>Brainstorm Possible Solutions</p>\n        <p>Get creative about possible solutions. When you brainstorm, don’t judge any of the solutions, just let them flow. Even if some ideas seem ridiculous, write them down. &nbsp;</p>\n        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max starts brainstorming the following solutions without judging them. </em><em>For instance,</em> g<em>round Max Jr. until he changes his attitude and does his homework; send Max Jr. to live with his grandmother; spend more quality time with Max Jr. and talk to him about problem solving; get a tutor for Max Jr.</em></p>\n        <p><strong>STEP 5: &nbsp;</strong>Evaluate Possible Solutions</p>\n        <p>Review the list of possible solutions and evaluate how well they may address the problem.</p>\n        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max makes a list of the pros and cons of each possible solution.</em></p>\n        <p><strong>STEP 6: &nbsp;</strong>Choose the Best Solution Based on Pros and Cons</p>\n        <p>Problem-solving experts suggest giving special considerations to the solution with the least cons. You may want to pick a second solution in case the first one does not work.</p>\n        <p><u>Example</u>: &nbsp;<em>Max studies his list of pros and cons for each possible solution.&nbsp; He finds that the solution with the most pros and fewest cons is to spend more quality time with his son.&nbsp; His back-up solution is to hire a tutor to help Max Jr. with his homework.</em></p>\n        <p><strong>STEP 7: &nbsp;</strong>Make a Plan and Try Your Solution</p>\n        <p>Now create a specific plan to carry out your solution. You may need to divide the plan into steps.&nbsp;</p>\n        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max has decided on a possible solution and forms a plan.&nbsp; He will sit down with Max Jr. this weekend to make a list of the boy’s favorite things to do.&nbsp; Then they will create a plan for Max Jr. to earn some privileges by spending more time on homework and helping around the house.&nbsp; Max will also make himself available in the evenings to help his son with homework.</em></p>\n        <p><strong>STEP 8: </strong>&nbsp;Assess the Solution’s Progress</p>\n        <p>Reevaluate the situation and see how the actions have changed things.</p>\n        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>A month later, Max evaluates his solution by contacting Max Jr’s teachers and learns his son is improving in his schoolwork.&nbsp; He also sees that Max Jr. volunteers for more chores around the house.&nbsp; Max decides that he has met the goal he set for solving his problem.</em></p>\n        <p><strong>STEP 9: </strong>&nbsp;If the First Solution Didn’t Work, Try Another!</p>\n        <p>If your solution worked, your stress should diminish.&nbsp; If it didn’t work, try another solution from Step 5 until you find one that works.</p>\n        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max feels much less irritable and stressed now.&nbsp; In fact, he looks forward to coming home from work.&nbsp; He also knows if his first solution didn’t work, he could have tried his second solution of hiring a tutor</em></p>\n        </div></div>\n        '}]},n.alcoholDrugsLib={id:2,title:"Alcohol and Drugs",content:"Use of alcohol and drugs can become a problem, especially when stresses of life in the military become a burden.

These substances make it more difficult to deal with stress and trauma.</p>\n        <p><strong>3.1 Post-Traumatic Stress Reactions</strong></p>\n        <p>Combat stress, or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), is a set of emotional challenges that occur after someone has been through a traumatic or stressful event.</p>\n        <p><strong>There are four main types of Post-Traumatic Stress reactions:</strong></p>\n        <ol><li><strong>Re-experiencing the trauma: </strong>Flashbacks, nightmares, memories you can\'t erase, or intense emotional and physical reactions to trauma reminders (being triggered)</li>\n        <li><strong>Negative changes in mood and thoughts</strong>: Always thinking that the world, other people or oneself are entirely bad or dangerous, lost interest in things, feeling detached from others, or unable to feel positively about oneself or others.</li>\n        <li><strong>Avoidance</strong>: Avoiding activities, people, or places that remind you of the trauma; avoiding talking or thinking about the trauma.</li>\n        <li><strong>Increased arousal</strong>: Having a hard time sleeping and concentrating, being irritable, on guard and "jumpy," or having intense responses to being startled (hitting the dirt).</li>\n        </ol>\n        <p><strong>3.2 Drinking and Using Drugs To Cope With Combat Stress</strong></p>\n        <p>To cope with these challenging reactions, service members often turn to substances to "self-medicate."&nbsp; But alcohol or drugs only provide <em>temporary</em> relief to painful memories and feelings.&nbsp; And those<br>substances produce a lot of downsides:</p>\n        <table width="594" height="354" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 297px;

Unfortunately, it doesn\'t work that way.&nbsp; Substance use affects combat stress, and combat stress can lead to substance abuse, so don’t ignore the link between the two.</p>\n        <p><strong>3.4&nbsp;Sleep Problems and Substance Abuse</strong></p>\n        <p>Many Service Members who have combat stress reactions also have the following sleep problems:</p>\n        <ul><li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Trouble falling asleep</li>\n        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Waking up often</li>\n        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Restless sleep</li>\n        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Nightmares</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Substances may help you fall asleep or avoid nightmares, but they may also make you more irritable and “on guard.”&nbsp; Drinking or smoking pot often makes it harder to get a restful night\'s sleep.&nbsp; Alcohol may help you fall asleep, but it prevents you from getting restful sleep.&nbsp; As the alcohol wears off, the body wakes up over and over again during the night.&nbsp; This contributes to feeling hung over, tired and irritable the next day. Using these substances to AVOID your feelings prevents healing and can make it worse, and can contribute to developing PTSD.</p>\n        <p><strong>3.5&nbsp;Developing Healthy Coping Skills</strong></p>\n        <p>Your reactions may seem worse and more intense when you don\'t have substances to numb your feelings.&nbsp; So you need an arsenal of coping skills to deal with your PTSD or combat stress reactions <em>without</em> using drugs or alcohol.&nbsp; You can:</p>\n        <ul><li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Practice relaxation exercises or slow, relaxing breathing.</li>\n        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Learn other stress management skills.</li>\n        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Fill your schedule with fun activities that don’t involve drinking or using drugs.</li>\n        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Talk to a trusted friend or family member.</li>\n        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Learn anger management skills, like taking a timeout or assertive communication.</li>\n        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Develop healthy bedtime habits and routines.</li>\n        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Exercise regularly.</li>\n        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Eat healthy foods.</li>\n        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Avoid sugar and caffeine.</li>\n        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Write about deployment memories and experiences.</li>\n        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Develop and maintain a spiritual life.</li>\n        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Talk to a professional and get some help.</li>\n        </ul>\n      '},{id:4,title:"4.0 Making Healthy Choices About Drugs and Alcohol",content:'\n        <p>In this section, you will learn how to make healthy choices about alcohol and drugs by learning about moderate drinking, tips for safe drinking, and the effects of your blood alcohol concentration.</p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p><strong>4.1&nbsp; What is Moderate Drinking?</strong></p>\n        <p>It is important to know how much drinking is too much, or "when to say when."&nbsp; For most adults, consuming a moderate amount of alcohol is not harmful and will not lead to alcohol-related problems.

Even this mental argument can lead to drug and alcohol use.<br><br>Cravings are not always easy to detect. Thoughts and cravings may pass through your mind unnoticed. It takes work to identify and stop a thought. But the more you think about using drugs or alcohol, the more likely you will start drinking or using again. This is called a "relapse."</p>\n      <p>Triggers, thoughts, cravings, and using all seem to get tangled together.&nbsp; To help you understand addiction, the usual sequence goes like this:<br>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">Trigger Thoughts =&gt; Craving =&gt; Drink/Use</span></strong></span></p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><strong>5.2&nbsp;Identifying Triggers</strong></p>\n      <p>Triggers that make you want to use alcohol or drugs can be <strong>external</strong>, such as activities, events, or situations.&nbsp; Triggers can also be <strong>internal</strong>, such as negative thoughts or feelings.<br><br>External Triggers</p>\n      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>When home alone</li>\n      <li>When with friends</li>\n      <li>At parties</li>\n      <li>At sporting events</li>\n      <li>At the movies</li>\n      <li>At bars or clubs</li>\n      <li>At the beach</li>\n      <li>At the park</li>\n      <li>At concerts</li>\n      <li>Before or during date</li>\n      <li>Before or after sex</li>\n      <li>Before after work</li>\n      <li>With a meal</li>\n      <li>After a pay day</li>\n      <li>While driving</li>\n      <li>At school</li>\n      <li>After going past a liquor store or your dealer\'s residence</li>\n      <li>When with friends who drink or use drugs<br type="_moz"><br>&nbsp;</li>\n      </ul><p>Internal Triggers</p>\n      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Fear</li>\n      <li>Frustration</li>\n      <li>Anger</li>\n      <li>Loneliness</li>\n      <li>Guilt</li>\n      <li>Nervousness</li>\n      <li>Confidence</li>\n      <li>Happiness</li>\n      <li>Feeling pressured</li>\n      <li>Depression</li>\n      <li>Insecurity</li>\n      <li>Relaxation</li>\n      <li>Embarrassment</li>\n      <li>Irritation</li>\n      <li>Sadness</li>\n      <li>Excitement</li>\n      <li>Jealousy</li>\n      <li>Boredom</li>\n      <li>Fatigue<br>&nbsp;</li>\n      </ul><p>Other Internal Triggers</p>\n      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Talking about an upsetting employment experience&nbsp;</li>\n      <li>Watching the news</li>\n      <li>Being reminded of deployment experiences</li>\n      <li>Having a nightmare</li>\n      <li>Reacting to combat stress reactions</li>\n      <li>Having trouble concentrating</li>\n      <li>Having trouble sleeping because of combat stress</li>\n      <li>Feeling irritable after being reminded of deployment expriences</li>\n      </ul><p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><strong>5.3&nbsp;How Can I Have Fun If I Don’t Drink or Use?</strong></p>\n      <p>Learn to combat boredom and loneliness, because these feelings trigger urges to drink or use.&nbsp; To fight boredom and loneliness:</p>\n      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><strong>Go to church, synagogue, mosque or temple:</strong> Joining a place of worship helps you find community, new relationships, and spiritual direction.</li>\n      <li><strong>Work out: </strong>Take a class at a local gym or community center.&nbsp; Try a new sport or physical activity, or a martial art.&nbsp; Or join a sports league or hiking group.</li>\n      <li><strong>Start or re-start a hobby: </strong>Find a group nearby with similar interests, whether it\'s music, motorcycles, reading, cooking, or travel.</li>\n      <li><strong>Meet for a Meal:</strong> Invite someone to have breakfast, lunch or dinner. &nbsp;Cook for your friends one week, and then ask your friends to cook for you the following week.</li>\n      <li><strong>Join a professional group or a neighborhood organization:&nbsp; </strong>You might also join groups based on a professional interest, or volunteer in your local community.</li>\n      <li><strong>Take a class:</strong> Expand your horizons by learning an instrument or taking a college or community education course.</li>\n      <li><strong>Join a Veterans organization:</strong> Groups such as the American Legion or Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) can give you a place to socialize with others who\'ve served.

Many VA hospitals offer support and treatment. Contact your local VA hospital or Vet Center for information about programs that work with substance use and combat stress problems. Schedule an appointment with a counselor. They will ask many questions about your substance use (including alcohol, drugs, and prescription medication). The two of you will also discuss the ways that substance use affects your combat stress or PTSD. If you are a service member, each service provides support services that will help you with substance abuse and combat stress/PTSD.</p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><strong>Other common treatment options:</strong></p>\n      <ul><li>Education</li>\n      <li>Individual therapy</li>\n      <li>Group therapy</li>\n      <li>Support groups</li>\n      <li>Alcoholics Anonymous / Narcotics Anonymous</li>\n      </ul><p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>Working on issues of PTSD and substance abuse at the same time isn’t easy. Your Post-Traumatic Stress reactions may get worse when you first stop drinking or using,. Substance abuse can cause sleep and relationship problems, which make PTSD worse. So working on both issues at the same time is more effective than working on them separately.</p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><strong>6.3 Medications for Substance Use Issues</strong></p>\n      <p>Besides therapy, medications can help you stop drinking.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><strong>Antabuse</strong> treats alcoholism.&nbsp; Antabuse makes people feel sick when they drink.&nbsp; Over time, they associate feeling sick with drinking. It\'s called "aversion therapy."</p>\n      <p><strong>Naltrexone</strong> is a newer medication to treat alcoholism.&nbsp; It is not aversion therapy, but it can help curb cravings. &nbsp;Naltrexone is not effective for everyone.&nbsp; Talk to your health care provider about it.</p>\n      <p>Other medications treat both PTSD and alcoholism.&nbsp; Antidepressants like Paxil and Zoloft may reduce alcohol use in people who also have PTSD.&nbsp; When some people take Naltrexone and an antidepressant, the combination helps reduce drinking more than taking each medication alone.</p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><strong>6.7 Willing to Cut Back, But Not Quit Entirely?</strong></p>\n      <ul><li>Write down reasons to limit your drinking or use (family, social, legal, work, etc).</li>\n      <li>Set a drinking goal.

A great way to reconnect with the family is to find out what happened while you were away.  Then you can tell them about the positive things that happened during your deployment. </p>\n        <p>Try these tips for reconnecting with family and friends:</p>\n        <ul><li>Go to a sporting event, concert or a movie together</li>\n        <li>Take a walk, hike, or a bike ride together</li>\n        <li>Talk about your experience living in a different country</li>\n        <li>Make a scrapbook of photo album of your lives together, with your deployments as one chapter in a larger story</li>\n        <li>Ask your family what they did while you were gone, you might ask:\n        <ul><li>“What were the best movies you saw?”</li>\n        <li>“What music have you been listening to?”</li>\n        <li>“Anything cool happen at work/school?”</li>\n        <li>“What funny things have the kids done lately?”</li>\n        </ul></li>\n        </ul>\n        <p><strong>1.3 Pay Attention to Positives</strong></p>\n        <p>As you readjust to life with your family, it’s easy to focus on the bad instead of the good.

But talking about those experiences with your family helps everyone.  Keep in mind that talking about your experiences doesn’t mean you have to tell people everything.  Here are suggestions for talking about your deployment without going into too much detail:</p>\n        <ul><li>“I saw and did some really intense things that are hard for me to talk about.  Thanks for your patience.”</li>\n        <li>“Sometimes my memories make me space out and I have a hard time concentrating.</li>\n        <li>"I need you to just listen sometimes, and not interrupt me.”</li>\n        <li>“I might need a few minutes to calm down—thanks for giving me some space.”</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Your family may need support because they may be worried or upset about what happened to you.</p>\n        <ul><li>Telling them what deployment was like for you.</li>\n        <li>Telling them which deployment memories affect you now.</li>\n        <li>Explaining that reminders of your deployment may make you distracted or tense.</li>\n        <li>Reminding them how much you care about them.</li>\n        <li>Enjoying fun activities together.</li>\n        <li>Listening to them with an open mind, even when you have a different opinion.</li>\n        <li>Acknowledging their feelings, “I know that this is hard for you too.”</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p><strong>1.5 Handling Conflict</strong></p>\n        <p>Arguments can make it hard to talk to your partner about deployments.  It’s important to discuss problems in a way that builds up the relationship instead of tearing it down.  Here are some ideas for handling conflicts with a family member:</p>\n        <ul><li><strong>Plan ahead. </strong> Schedule time to discuss the problem.  This gives both of you time to think about what to say.  Find a time when you can talk without distractions.</li>\n        <li><strong>Identify your goal.  </strong>If your goal is to "win" the argument, your relationship will suffer.  Seek an outcome that will satisfy you both.  This usually requires compromises from both partners.</li>\n        <li><strong>"I" Statements.  </strong>When you bring up an issue, don’t blame the other person.  Blame makes people defensive.  Instead, use “I” statements, telling the other person how you feel.</li>\n        </ul><p >Instead of saying, "you never listen to me," say, "I feel frustrated when you read the newspaper while I’m talking."</p>\n        <p >Instead of saying "That\'s ridiculous!" say, "I don\'t understand what you mean. Can you explain it again?"</p>\n        <ul ><li><strong>Stick to one topic.  </strong>Bring up a specific issue that happened.  Tell the other person exactly what happened and why it bothered you.  Focus on resolving the issue, instead of bringing up other things.  Avoid saying "always” or “never”.</li>\n        </ul><p >Instead of saying "You always nag me!" say, "Sometimes I need a few minutes to unwind after work."</p>\n        <ul ><li><strong>Stay calm: </strong>When you get upset, you\'re less likely to think clearly, and you\'re more likely to say things that don\'t help the situation.  Stay calm, and you\'ll be better able to solve the problem.</li>\n        </ul><p >To stay calm, take breaks during the discussion.  Practice relaxing by counting to 10, breathing slowly, or taking a brief walk to relieve tension.</p>\n        <p >Be sure to tell your partner if you need a short break from the conversation so it doesn\'t seem like you\'re walking away.</p>\n        <ul><li><strong>No "below the belt"</strong> <strong>shots</strong>.  Shouting, name-calling, foul language, threats, and sarcasm usually make arguments worse and make it harder to find common ground.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p><strong>1.6 Approaches That Do “More Harm Than Good”</strong></p>\n        <p>Avoid <strong>criticizing</strong> and <strong>lashing out</strong> in anger during arguments.  Trying to control a conversation by demanding that others respond in a certain way won’t get you good results.  Finally, don’t expect others to solve problems for you<strong>.</strong>  You need to help find the solution.</p>\n        <p><strong>1.7 Your Communication Plan</strong></p>\n        <ul><li>Develop a "Communication Plan" to talk about deployment with your family. </li>\n        <li>Decide ahead of time what you want to discuss.</li>\n        <li>Share a little at a time, and then let the other person respond.</li>\n        <li>Learn to endure painful feelings so you don\'t lash out while sharing.</li>\n        <li>Listen without interrupting or getting defensive.</li>\n        <li>Ask for feedback.</li>\n        <li>Ask the other person to share their own feelings, experiences, and ways of coping.</li>\n        <li>Own up to your feelings and behavior – don\'t blame others for how you feel.</li>\n        </ul>\n      '},{id:2,title:"2.0 - Improving Your Relationships",content:"\n        <p>After challenging and potentially life changing experiences like deployment, you may find that you want to spend time alone.  It’s natural to want some time to yourself.  If you had an intense combat experience (like being injured or witnessing a death of a friend), it may be difficult to get close to other people right now.  Or you may prefer to spend time only with “battle buddies”, avoiding friends who don’t share your deployment experiences.  These are all normal and common feelings held by many service members returning from deployment.</p>\n        <p>There’s nothing wrong with spending some time alone, but isolating yourself from others can become a bad habit. To reconnect with your friends and community, we recommend that you work through the following sections in order:</p>\n        <ol ><li>Overcome isolation</li>\n        <li>Strengthen your network of relationships</li>\n        <li>Share your deployment experiences</li>\n        <li>Manage problem situations</li>\n        </ol>\n        <p><strong>2.1 Overcoming Isolation</strong></p>\n        <p>After an intense experience like deployment, you may feel awkward and lonely around others.  You might keep to yourself because it allows you to avoid situations that bring up painful feelings or memories.  But if you cut yourself off from your friends, you won’t get the support you need and deserve.  Avoiding people can actually increase those upsetting thoughts and feelings.</p>\n        <p><strong>2.2 Tips For Beating Isolation</strong></p>\n        <p>You may have to push yourself to spend time with others. Remember that being around others is important for your well-being.</p>\n        <ul ><li>Be intentional.  Plan to socialize with others.  Stick to your plan even when you’d rather be alone.</li>\n        <li>Spend time with people you trust, in places where you are comfortable.</li>\n        <li>Start with short outings, staying a little longer each time.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p><strong>2.3 Strengthening Your Network</strong></p>\n        <p>Returning service members often think they have little in common with their family and friends back home.

But connecting with others helps you:</p>\n        <ul ><li>Improve your mood</li>\n        <li>Decrease your boredom</li>\n        <li>Deal with painful thoughts and feelings about your deployment</li>\n        <li>Find solutions to your problems</li>\n        <li>Avoid harmful coping methods (like heavy drinking)</li>\n        <li>REALIZE you are not alone<br type=\"_moz\" /><br /> </li>\n        </ul><p>It's important to strengthen your social network in the months following a deployment.  Some people like having a large and mixed social network.  Others prefer a smaller circle of friends.  Either way, it helps to have people you can count on when you need them.  Your social network includes:</p>\n        <ul ><li>Family members and friends</li>\n        <li>Neighbors</li>\n        <li>Co-workers</li>\n        <li>Community members such as members of church or sports league</li>\n        <li>Professionals such as counselors, therapists and doctors</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p><strong>2.4 Expanding Your Network</strong></p>\n        <p>Being with others gives you a sense of belonging and security, lifts your spirits, and eases your worries.  Don’t forget, you may be a source of comfort and friendship for others, too! </p>\n        <p>Here are some things you can do to be part of your community and increase your social support network:</p>\n        <ul ><li>Get some exercise.  Join a pick-up game.  Take and exercise class at a local gym or community center. Sports leagues and hiking groups are great ways to meet people while staying fit.  You could also try a new sport of physical activity.</li>\n        <li>Get a hobby.  Find local people who share your interest in music, motorcycles, professional sports, cooking, and books</li>\n        <li>Join a place of worship.  Joining a church, synagogue, mosque or temple can give you spiritual directions and help you become part of the community</li>\n        <li>Join a professional group or neighborhood organization.  Get involved in a Neighborhood Watch group, or a group based on professional interests</li>\n        <li>Volunteer.  Get involved in community service projects—clean up a local park or volunteer at a hospital</li>\n        <li>Join a veteran's organization.  Groups such as the VA, the American Legion, and Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) are safe places to talk and fit in.  You’re probably eligible to join these groups, even if you’re currently active duty</li>\n        <li>Join a cause.  Work with others toward a goal you believe in, such as an election or the protection of a natural area</li>\n        </ul>\n      "},{id:3,title:"3.0 - Talking to Others About Deployment Experiences",content:'\n        <p>Talking about your intense deployment experience can ease the impact of it.

It can limit your ability to understand what happened or deal with your feelings.  On the other hand, talking about your deployment all the time can be too much for you and others to handle.  Finding a balance between these extremes is the goal.</p>\n        <ul ><li>How do you open up to others and strengthen your social ties?  Things you may want to talk about include:</li>\n        <li>The actual events of your deployment</li>\n        <li>Thoughts and feelings you have about those events</li>\n        <li>Ways you’ve coped with your experiences</li>\n        <li>Ways you’ve grown or changed since your deployment</li>\n        <li>Practical decisions, such as what to do about your job</li>\n        <li>Thoughts about your future</li>\n        <li>Ways you found strength you didn\'t know you had</li>\n        <li>Things you’ve learned that might help others to cope with similar experiences<br /> </li>\n        </ul><p>You should also figure out the best times to talk about what happened.  It’s a good idea to wait to talk about your deployment until:</p>\n        <ul ><li>You’re well rested</li>\n        <li>You’re with someone you know and trust</li>\n        <li>You’ve got enough time to share your thoughts and get feedback</li>\n        <li>You’re not already feeling upset</li>\n        <li>You’ve got some privacy<br /> </li>\n        </ul><p>Other service members worry about getting emotional when talking about deployment.  If that worries you, remember these tips:</p>\n        <ul ><li>It’s ok to get emotional.  Once you share, your emotions won’t seem as overwhelming</li>\n        <li>Tell the person you may get emotional, and you’d appreciate their support if you do.</li>\n        <li>Take a chance.  Talk about painful feelings or thoughts even if it’s hard.</li>\n        <li>Expect some uncomfortable feelings after talking about hard issues.  Know that these feeling are easier to handle with time and practice.</li>\n        <li>Inform the other person you may need to take a break to calm down or collect yourself.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>When you finish talking:</p>\n        <ul ><li>Thank the person for listening.  They should know you value their time and support.</li>\n        <li>Schedule a cool-down time after talking.  Do something fun and easy to help shift back to the present.</li>\n        <li>Plan to talk about your deployment with someone you trust.  Schedule your plan once a week or once a month.</li>\n        <li>Expect the other person to respond in ways that bother or upset you.

Anxiety can be a normal reaction to new and positive challenges or to stressful events.  \n        But, anxiety can also be the result of distorted thinking and other controllable causes; if not  controlled, anxiety  can become problematic and  interfere with  your health and wellness.</p>\n        <p>Anxiety is a mix of thoughts, emotions and physical reactions.  People describe experiencing “butterflies” or “knots” in their bellies, or a pounding heart, or chest tightness.  \n        Anxiety can be useful, signaling the body to go “on alert” and prepare for action.  Anxiety can be a motivator or a response to the anticipation of an event.  \n        Anxiety can signal a person to act, which can facilitate coping with a difficult situation.</p>\n        <p>Worry is the thinking part of anxiety in which the worrier regularly predicts the occurrence of negative or catastrophic events in his life or in the life of loved ones. Worried thinking often leads anxiety’s physical symptoms (rapid heartbeat, restlessness, disrupted sleep, etc.).</p>\n        <p>Everyone worries about something at one time or another. But, worry becomes problematic when it is chronic and interferes with daily living.&nbsp; It becomes a cycle that is difficult to break and may cause you to make significant lifestyle changes like isolating yourself or avoiding public places.&nbsp; Worried thinking focuses on the likelihood of negative outcomes without realistic efforts to plan or problem solve.&nbsp; Worry is about living in the future by always thinking “What if?”<br>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p>Here are some signs that worry might be problematic in your life:</p>\n        <ul><li>Here are some signs that worry might be problematic in your life:</li>\n        <li>You are chronically on alert and thinking about potential future dangers or threats</li>\n        <li>You are consistently making negative predictions about the future</li>\n        <li>You tend to overestimate the likelihood that something bad will happen</li>\n        <li>You repeat worried thoughts over and over again in your head</li>\n        </ul><p><br><strong>Here is an example of worry leading to anxiety:</strong></p>\n        <p><em>Jim hopes to be promoted at his job.&nbsp; He has been in the same position for five years and has been working hard.&nbsp; He was deployed for 12 months and has returned to work.&nbsp; Since returning from deployment, he has received consistently positive feedback and yearly reviews from his employer.&nbsp; Jim passed the preliminary review for the promotion, and has a formal, in-person interview coming up.&nbsp; Jim is worried (predicting) that he will not get the job, even though he believes that he is the most qualified candidate for the position.&nbsp; Jim thinks he will be too anxious to accurately answer the interviewer’s questions, even though he has been preparing himself for two weeks.&nbsp; He finds himself wondering: “What if my mind goes blank? What if they view my deployment negatively? What if the roads are icy and I can’t get to the interview on time? What if I spill coffee on myself the morning before the interview?” Every time he thinks (worries) about the interview his heart races, his palms sweat and he has butterflies (anxiety).</em><br><br><br>This example shows how worried thinking can lead to anxiety.

I worry a lot about social situations.&nbsp; I turn down invitations to social events and avoid situations that make my anxiety unbearable.&nbsp; It’s like my spider sense is always tingling for no reason.”<br><br>Lenore, age 26: “I have absolutely no self-confidence, and just thinking about social gatherings makes me feel depressed about myself.&nbsp; If I have a couple of weeks to prepare myself, I can drag through alright.&nbsp; But even going to parties with people I know, or running into someone I know is difficult.”</p>\n        <p>Tina, age 29: “I dread going out for dinner in groups larger than about six.&nbsp; I hate sitting around the table trying to think of something to talk about that isn’t boring, worrying that people think I’m boring and feeling that everyone is noticing that no one is talking to me — trying and failing to catch someone’s attention by speaking to them and feeling really stupid…thinking everyone else is wittier and funnier than me.”</p>\n        <p>Gino, age 35: “I feel very self-conscious about blushing.&nbsp; The slightest little dig or comment towards me results in my face going bright red and I can feel myself start sweating, basically making me look like a fool.&nbsp; This also happens in other situations such as walking into a place with lots of people around, or doing things like talking one on one to someone I don’t know that well.”<br>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p><strong>What a Provider Might Ask in Evaluating for Social Anxiety:</strong></p>\n        <ul><li>In the past month, did you have an intense fear of embarrassment or being criticized by others in social, occupational, or performance situations (e.g., eating in front of people, speaking in front of others, talking to people you did not know, dating, attending parties or social gatherings, etc.)?</li>\n        <li>In the past month, did you avoid or feel extremely anxious or distressed in any feared social, occupational, or performance situations?</li>\n        <li>In the past month, did your intense fear of being embarrassed or criticized by other people in social, occupational, or performance situations cause an inability to function?</li>\n        </ul></div>\n      '},{id:3,title:"3.0 Other Problems Associated with Anxiety",content:'\n        <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Anxiety is often accompanied by other conditions.</p>\n          <ul><li><strong>Alcohol abuse:</strong> Many people who feel anxious use alcohol to try to calm down and cope with anxious feelings, especially in social situations.&nbsp; However, alcohol can make anxiety and panic symptoms worse.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n          <li><strong>Depression:</strong> Those with anxiety disorders are commonly affected by depression, and approximately half of those individuals diagnosed with depression also have symptoms of anxiety disorders.&nbsp; This is often caused by a sense of loss of control when an anxiety disorder causes significant disruption in life.&nbsp; When the anxiety disorder is treated successfully, the depression often improves as well.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n          <li><strong>Eating disorders:</strong> Individuals with eating disorders spend a lot of time focused on their weight, appearance, food intake, and exercise.

Repeating this pattern over time can lead to weight gain and obesity.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n          <li><strong>Medical conditions:</strong> Anxiety problems can lead to a dependence on anxiety medications.&nbsp; In addition, anxiety can cause a person to avoid medical treatment and dental procedures; on the opposite side of the spectrum, their unrealistic fear of disease may lead them to engage in unnecessary, and sometimes dangerous, medical tests and procedures.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n          <li><strong>Sleep Problems:</strong> The symptoms associated with anxiety like racing thoughts, racing heart can interfere with getting to sleep and staying asleep.</li>\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n      '},{id:4,title:"4.0 Causes of Anxiety",content:'\n        <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded">\n          <p>Family history and genetics, learned behaviors, brain chemistry, and experiencing traumatic events have all been identified as contributing to or increasing the risk of developing anxiety.<br><br><strong>Family History/Genetics</strong><br>Often anxiety disorders are hereditary.&nbsp; If parents or other close relatives have had problems with anxiety, children are more likely to develop an anxiety disorder.<br><br><strong>Learning</strong><br>Children learn how to behave by observing others.&nbsp; Parents who regularly predict negative outcomes increase the probability that their children will learn this style of thinking and develop anxious behaviors.<br><br><strong>Brain Chemistry</strong><br>Thoughts and feelings are regulated by chemical messengers in the brain, called&nbsp;neurotransmitters.&nbsp; If theses neurotransmitters become unbalanced or do not work correctly, anxiety symptoms can increase.<br><br><strong>Traumatic Events</strong><br>A traumatic event, such as witnessing a death, or being in combat, can lead to feelings of anxiety.&nbsp; If unable to resolve the anxiety surrounding the event, anxiety can increase and morph into other anxious thoughts and behaviors.</p>\n          <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        </div>\n      '},{id:5,title:"5.0 Factors that Make Anxiety Worse",content:'\n        <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">Recognizing that life circumstances can worsen is an important first step toward reducing anxiety.&nbsp; In this section you will learn a little more about the following factors:</p>\n          <ul><li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Stress</li>\n          <li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Caffeine and Other Stimulants</li>\n          <li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Problems Being Assertive</li>\n          <li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Unrealistic Thinking</li>\n          <li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Poor Coping Skills</li>\n          </ul><p>&nbsp;</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded">\n          <p>Stress affects everyone; however, overwhelming stress can result in anxiety, especially for people who are vulnerable or actively diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.</p>\n          <p><strong>Relationship/Family stress</strong>: Relationships with significant others and family members can be a great source of support.&nbsp; \n          When these relationships become strained, which frequently happens following a deployment, the support gained from those relationships is affected.&nbsp; \n          This can cause an increase in stress and worries.</p>\n          <p><strong>Deployment stress:</strong>&nbsp; The uncertainties created by deployment can cause significant stress.&nbsp; \n          These uncertainties affect both the deployed and those who are left at home.&nbsp; Increased responsibilities, less support, and changed roles can increase the likelihood of worry and anxiety.</p>\n          <p>\n          <strong>Job stress:</strong> Returning from a deployment often means returning to a different kind of work or starting a new job.&nbsp; These changes can be very stressful and can make anxiety worse.</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded">\n          <p>Cutting back on caffeine or going “cold turkey” can cause a slight increase in anxiety and physical symptoms (e.g. headaches) at first, but this will decrease as your body adjusts.</p>\n          <p>Nicotine in cigarettes or smokeless tobacco can also increase anxiety.&nbsp; If you use caffeine and/or nicotine regularly, you might not even realize their impact on your mood.&nbsp;</p>\n          <p>&nbsp;</p>\n          <p>Assertive communication is expressing thoughts and feelings in a non-threatening and non-aggressive manner.

The positive is forgotten or ignored, and only the bad things are considered.<br><br><strong>Not accepting the positive:</strong> People with this thinking error reject anything positive, especially positive information about themselves.<br><br><strong>Reasoning with feelings instead of logic or facts:</strong> Saying, “I feel like a loser, so I must be a loser,” is an example of using feelings instead of facts as proof of truth.<br><br><strong>Jumping to Conclusions:</strong> This type of thinking error happens when people think they know what will happen without first finding out the facts. Expecting something bad to happen usually goes along with this type of thinking. Mind-reading is another way of jumping to conclusions. An example of mind-reading is when a person thinks he knows what others are thinking, without finding out the truth first. Mind-reading often results in incorrectly believing what the other person is thinking.<br><br><strong>Labeling:</strong> A person can label&nbsp;his or herself, or label others, based on very little information or based on mistakes that were made. When people label themselves they often do so harshly. This has the effect of making it harder to accept mistakes. And, once the labels get “attached,” they become difficult to remove.<br><br><strong>“Should” Statements:</strong> “Should” statements are based on rules or standards that people set up for themselves and others to follow, but are usually impossible to do all of the time. People sometimes set the standards so high that they set themselves and others up to fail, which only confirms the negative thoughts.<br><br><strong>Taking it personally:</strong> Taking things too personally involves the assumption that others do negative things on purpose. People who take things too personally may also tend to take responsibility for something that they’re not responsible for.</p>\n        </div>\n        <p>Anxiety is unlikely to resolve or improve when effective coping skills are absent.  Coping skills help individuals deal with a problem or with general life stress. When a person doesn’t know how to cope with life stress, his or her anxiety can increase. Poor coping skills include things like avoiding or denying the problem, drinking or drugging, not asking for help, and self-blaming.</p>\n      '},{id:6,title:"6.0 Understanding Panic Disorder",content:'\n        <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>&nbsp;Panic Disorders are extremely common in the civilian population.&nbsp; People who suffer from panic attacks often mistake the symptoms for a severe illness.&nbsp; For example, heart attack, stroke, severe mental illness, lung and breathing problems, or brain tumors.&nbsp; While panic symptoms can be uncomfortable and certainly are a nuisance, it’s important to understand that they are not dangerous, they can’t hurt you.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, once people stop fearing their symptoms, they tend to go away. Due to combat and re-integration experiences, service members and veterans have a high likelihood of experiencing physical symptoms of anxiety and then developing catastrophic thinking about the meaning of the symptoms.<br>&nbsp;</p>\n          <p>Many people experience feelings of panic.&nbsp; It is normal and healthy to feel a sense of panic when under fire by the enemy or when a child goes missing while playing at the park.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, nobody interprets the symptoms as an illness.&nbsp; People expect to feel this way in a crisis and the physical sensations go away as soon as the crisis is over.&nbsp; When an actual crisis is present, the physical symptoms signal the body to go ‘on alert’ and prepare for the fight-or-flight response.&nbsp; It was designed to allow&nbsp;humans to protect themselves by confronting the problem (fight) or by removing themselves from the dangerous situation (flight).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>\n          <p>However, panic attacks can occur when serious situations are not present.&nbsp; When they come “out of the blue” (i.e. without explanation) the physical sensations can be frightening.&nbsp; The physical symptoms of panic are often uncomfortable and produce fear when catastrophic thinking takes over.&nbsp; Because of this, individuals with panic begin to avoid situations in which others might see them or in which they might not be able to escape.&nbsp; Individuals may also avoid physical activities (including formal and informal exercise) that can cause physical responses similar to those experienced in panic.<br>&nbsp;</p>\n          <p>Remember that many people experience feelings of panic and can mistake their symptoms as illness.&nbsp;

The therapist works with the client to change irrational thoughts and beliefs to more realistic thoughts and to determine what behaviors are the result of the unrealistic thoughts.&nbsp; Positive changes in thoughts and behaviors are likely to result in reduced anxiety.<br><br>Exposure therapy is a treatment strategy in which a therapist works with a client to seek out, under controlled conditions, anxiety producing situations that the client finds frightening.&nbsp; By doing so, individuals learn that neither the feared situation nor the physical symptoms that can occur are dangerous and that other catastrophic thoughts are not accurate.&nbsp; With practice, the fear of situations or physical symptoms gradually evaporates over time.<br><br><strong>Medication</strong></p>\n        <p>There are a number of medications available that are sometimes used for treating anxiety. These medications change how brain chemicals called neurotransmitters are produced or used.&nbsp; How effective a medication will be for any one person depends on factors such as body type, drug sensitivity and side effects.

For example, “What if the plane crashes?” or “What if I forget my speech in the middle of it?"&nbsp; If you begin to pay attention to how often you use this phrase, you’ll be able to start challenging the thought once you begin to practice distinguishing possible from probable.<br><br><strong>Learn to distinguish the difference between "possible" and "probably" events: </strong>How often do you say "It\'s possible that (this or that bad thing) will happen." Anxiety is created when we say “possible”, but we mean “probable” or “likely”.&nbsp; Because anything is possible it’s easy to create fear by thinking anything is probable.&nbsp; While it’s possible that you could be killed the next time you drive your car, it’s not probable or likely based on your own personal experience on the road.&nbsp; If you learn to accurately assess risk and challenge unrealistic thinking, you can reduce anxiety.<br><br><strong>Examine the facts; what actually happened: </strong>Pay<strong> </strong>attention to what actually happens in life, rather than what could happen, might happen, or almost happened, is a powerful way of confirming for yourself that the world is not as dangerous as it could be.&nbsp; While bad things can happen, most of the time they don’t, and it’s worth paying attention to that as you go through life.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Stop fighting anxiety:</strong>&nbsp; This may seem wrong, but research has shown that trying to fight anxiety, both anxious thoughts and the physical effects, is not a permanent answer to ending anxiety. Whether you use distraction, avoidance or attempts at escape, or the more useful strategies such as breathing exercises and progressive relaxation, they rarely will stop anxious thoughts or symptoms permanently, they always seem return.&nbsp;<br><br>What we know about behavior is “What you resist, persists."&nbsp; Instead of trying to resist worried thinking, focus on the fact that the symptoms of anxiety and panic attacks may be uncomfortable but they can’t hurt you.&nbsp; Learning not to fear these symptoms allows them to have much less of an impact.<br><br><strong>Exposure exercises: </strong>Prove to yourself that your symptoms from anxiety and panic can\'t hurt!&nbsp; Of course that can be somewhat frightening if you really believe that the situation is dangerous.&nbsp; Exposure usually involves confronting your fear by entering a feared situation (e.g., a crowded restaurant, a tall building, a social gathering) and staying in the situation while practicing realistic thinking (“No one is attacking me”, “I’m not going to die”, “This isn’t hurting me”).&nbsp; Over time, catastrophic thinking is eliminated because nothing harmful (other than some uncomfortable anxiety symptoms) actually happens.&nbsp; With practice the anxiety symptoms go away.&nbsp; Exposure is best learned with the help of a trained therapist, but can be practiced on your own once you learn how. Sometimes it is hard to pinpoint your trigger.&nbsp; If you can’t identify it, don’t worry.&nbsp; Work on relaxing and calming yourself.</p>\n        </div>\n      '},{id:9,title:"9.0 Getting Support for Anxiety",content:'\n        <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Finding people who can help you cope with anxious feelings can be very beneficial.&nbsp;</p>\n          <p><strong>Families and friends:</strong> Talking to family and friends about anxiety can be scary and anxiety-producing in and of itself, but family and friends can be a great source of support.&nbsp; They can be comforting because they know you and can help you cope with difficult times.&nbsp;</p>\n          <p><strong>Support groups:</strong> Support groups give you a chance to connect with other people who have similar experiences.&nbsp; Formal support groups for anxiety conditions and groups for other factors contributing to anxiety such as single parenting, grief, and nightmares can also be very helpful.&nbsp; If you\'re a veteran you can find more information on these groups&nbsp;at your local VA center.
