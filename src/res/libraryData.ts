        </ol><p><br><strong>2.1 Definition of Stressors</strong></p>
        <p>A “stressor” is anything you perceive as a personal threat or beyond your ability to manage.&nbsp; Stressors can be minor hassles or serious life challenges.&nbsp; Stressors can also be thoughts and memories of painful past events.&nbsp; Even though you’re unaware of it, you constantly monitor what’s going on around and inside you.&nbsp; You judge whether situations are a threat to your well-being.&nbsp; You also judge whether you can manage or cope with things.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2.2 Types of Stressors&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>It’s important to understand the things that cause you to feel stressed.&nbsp; Once you know the sources of your stress, you will be able to anticipate and manage your stress more effectively. Here are some different types of stressors.</p>
        <p><strong>Life Events and Stressful Living Conditions:</strong></p>

        </ul><p><br><strong>2.3 Trigger Stressors</strong></p>
        <p>Certain events that happen during daily living can trigger stress responses. For instance, after returning from deployment, it’s normal for sounds (a car backfiring), sights (upset children), or smells (diesel fuel) that you associated with stressful deployment triggers. Triggers may also remind you of stressful events from your life before the military. If you often over-react to things, or if ordinary events set you off, your stress level may be too high.</p>

        <div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>There are many healthy ways to manage your stress.&nbsp; In this chapter we will explore different skills and techniques.<br><br><strong>3.1 Quick Stress Reduction Exercises</strong></p>
        <p>When stressed, your breathing becomes fast and shallow and your muscles tense.&nbsp; You can interrupt the stress response with slow, deep breathing and relaxing your muscles.<br><br><strong>3.2 Deep Breathing Technique</strong></p>
        <p>Like any other skill you learn, deep breathing <strong><em>must be practiced</em></strong>.&nbsp; It is easy to learn and reduces tension, anxiety, and irritability.&nbsp; When you breathe slowly and deeply, your heart rate slows and your blood pressure is lowered.&nbsp; The following exercise takes 2 minutes:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Slowly inhale air deeply into your belly until fully extended.&nbsp; Keep your chest still.</li>
        <li>Now exhale slowly, allowing the air you breathe out to deflate your belly.</li>
        <li>Pause naturally, and&nbsp;then repeat.</li>
        <li>Inhale and exhale counting to the number eight, then inhale and exhale counting backward from eight.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Focus on breathing, counting, and relaxing.</li>
        </ul><p><br>You <strong><em>will</em></strong> get results if you keep practicing!&nbsp;<br><br><strong>3.3 Progressive Muscle Relaxation Technique</strong><br><br>If you’re not in a position to fight or flee, you will continue to feel physically stressed.&nbsp; But if you can relax your muscles, your physical stress will subside.&nbsp; Learning to relax your muscles reduces tension and calms you.&nbsp; Here’s how to relax your muscles:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Sit or lie in a comfortable position with your feet, hands, arms, and neck supported.</li>
        <li>Take a few deep breaths and think the word “relax”.</li>
        <li>Focus on your legs and feet.&nbsp; Tense your legs by flexing your feet and pointing your toes toward your upper body.&nbsp; You’ll feel tension spread through your feet and legs.</li>
        <li>Hold for a few seconds and then release.&nbsp; Relax your feet and legs completely, while thinking the word “relax”.</li>
        <li>Now focus on your belly.&nbsp; Tense your belly by pulling it in toward your spine.</li>
        <li>Hold for a few seconds then release.&nbsp; Tense your hands and arms by making a tight fist and tensing your forearms, biceps, and triceps.</li>
        <li>Hold for a few seconds and then release.&nbsp; Relax your hands and arms completely, while thinking the word “relax”.</li>
        <li>Continue by tensing the following muscle groups:</li>
        <li>Your shoulders</li>
        <li>Your jaw</li>
        <li>The muscles around your eyes</li>
        <li>Your forehead</li>
        <li>Hold the tension in each muscle group for a few seconds and then release the tension and think the word “relax”.</li>
        <li>Once you complete this exercise, you should feel more relaxed and your stress level should decrease.</li>

        <div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>In this chapter you will learn several strategies you can use to help change the way you think about real life situations you find yourself that may cause you stress. Changing the way you think can change the way you feel.<br><br><strong>Mental Reframing</strong></p>
        <p>The way people think about things affects their reactions to stress.&nbsp; After a deployment, you may believe the world is a more dangerous place or constantly worry that harm could come to you or your loved ones.&nbsp; Or you may feel you have less control over your life.&nbsp; These thoughts may cause you to look at situations and events differently than before you were deployed.&nbsp; It’s normal to think differently about your environment after a deployment.</p>
        <p>Everyone has a constant stream of thoughts running through their minds—this is called <strong>self-talk</strong>.&nbsp; Self-talk reflects your beliefs and attitudes about the world, other people, and yourself.&nbsp; It’s important to examine your thoughts and beliefs carefully challenge those thoughts that are not realistic of helpful.</p>
        <p>Mental reframing is a process you can learn to interrupt self-talk and challenge negative thoughts with more realistic, positive thoughts.&nbsp; There are 5 steps involved in mental reframing:</p>
        <p><strong>Step 1: Self-monitoring</strong></p>
        <p>Your first step in mental reframing is to monitor your thoughts (self-talk).&nbsp; Your awareness of self-talk in stressful situations will help you to prepare to <strong><em>think</em></strong> differently.</p>
        <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td height="58">
        <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>
        <div>
        <p>&nbsp;(<strong>A</strong>)ctivating event <strong>+</strong> (<strong>B</strong>)eliefs&nbsp; <strong>= </strong>(<strong>C</strong>)onsequences)</p>
        </div>
        </td>
        </tr></tbody></table></td>
        </tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Step 2: The ABC Method</strong></p>
        <p>The second step in mental reframing is to identify those thoughts that cause feelings and motivate your behavior.&nbsp; In most situations, people do not automatically respond to events.&nbsp; People usually think about an event, about their ability to manage the situation, and <em>then</em> they respond.&nbsp; Often your thoughts or interpretation of a stressful event leads to a stress reaction.&nbsp; The “ABC” method is a good way to think of the relationship between thoughts and behaviors:</p>
        <ol style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>An <u><strong>A</strong></u>ctivating event is a stressful situation or event</li>
        <li>The event triggers thought or <u><strong>B</strong></u>eliefs</li>
        <li>As a <u><strong>C</strong></u>onsequence your beliefs about the event change your stress level</li>
        </ol><p><br>Here is an example of the ABC model:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><u>A</u><u>ctivating event</u>: While on leave, you hop on a bus to visit family. The bus gets stuck in traffic because of road construction.</li>
        <li><u>Beliefs</u>: As you take in the situation, you begin to form beliefs about the event. Your beliefs determine whether you see this as a minor inconvenience or a major problem.</li>
        <li><u>Consequences</u>: The consequence of your beliefs is that you feel stressed OR relaxed for the rest of the ride, depending on what your beliefs tell you.</li>
        </ul><p><br><u>Negative Beliefs about the event</u></p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>This will take forever.&nbsp; I’ll never get home.</li>
        <li>Why does this always happen to me?</li>
        <li>They always do construction at the worst times.</li>
        </ul><p><u>Positive Beliefs about the event</u></p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>I’ll just be a few minutes late.</li>
        <li>I’m going to listen to some music while I wait.</li>
        <li>I’m glad they are fixing the road</li>
        </ul><p><br><u>Step 3: Negative Thought Patterns</u></p>
        <p>The third step in mental reframing is to recognize when your beliefs about an event or situation are unhelpful or negative.&nbsp; The following are examples of negative thought patterns that can increase stress levels:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><u>All or Nothing</u>: You tend to experience things in black and white terms.&nbsp; You see situations as either entirely “<em>good</em>” or “<em>bad</em>”, when there is clearly a middle ground.&nbsp; An example of all-or-nothing thinking is that <strong><em>either</em></strong> you are perfect <strong><em>or </em></strong>you’re a failure.</li>
        <li><u>Exaggeration</u>: Sometimes exaggeration is also called “catastrophizing”.&nbsp; This thinking pattern involves blowing the imagined consequences of an event out of proportion.&nbsp; You may see minor problems as being “horrible” or “disastrous”.&nbsp; Others may say “you’re making a mountain out of a molehill”.&nbsp; Sometimes it is hard to pinpoint your trigger.&nbsp; If you can’t identify it, don’t worry.&nbsp; Work on relaxing and calming yourself.</li>
        <li><u>Overgeneralization</u>: &nbsp;You take an isolated experience or piece of information and draw the wrong conclusions.&nbsp; You see isolated negative events as a never-ending pattern of negative events or defeat.&nbsp; For example, if someone turns you down for a date, you conclude that you are <em>always</em> rejected or that you will <em>never</em> find the right person.&nbsp; Look for words such as <strong>always</strong> or <strong>never </strong>in your self-talk as signs that you are over generalizing.</li>
        <li><u>Mind-reading</u>: You assume you know what another person is thinking, even though you have no evidence to back up your assumptions.&nbsp; When you mind-read, you almost always assume that someone is thinking the worst about you.&nbsp; For example, you might think your friends don’t want to hear about your deployment experiences.&nbsp; In reality, your friends want to know what happened but feel awkward asking you questions.&nbsp; Look for phrases like <strong>he/ she probably thinks</strong>...or <strong>they don’t understand</strong>… in your self-talk as signs that you are mind-reading.</li>
        </ul><p><br><u>Step 4: Challenging Your Thoughts</u></p>
        <p>The fourth step in mental reframing is to challenge your negative thinking patterns and self-talk.&nbsp; This takes a lot of practice and patience because self-talk is a reflection of your core beliefs about yourself, others, and the world.</p>
        <p>Look carefully for evidence that challenges negative or stressful self-talk.&nbsp; In order to challenge your negative thinking, you can ask yourself the following questions:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Is there evidence for or against my stressful thought or belief?</li>
        <li>Am I thinking in all-or-nothing terms?</li>
        <li>Am I using words or phrases such as disastrous, horrible, and awful?</li>
        <li>Am I making sweeping generalizations based on a single event?</li>
        <li>Am I using words like always and never in my self-talk?</li>
        <li>Am I judging what other people think, when I really don’t know what they think?</li>
        <li>Is my information source reliable?</li>
        <li>Are my beliefs based on feelings rather than facts?</li>
        </ul><p><br><u>Step 5: Using Positive Self-talk</u></p>
        <p>The final step in mental reframing is to replace negative, stressful self-talk with positive, empowering self-talk.&nbsp; You may be surprised at how changing your outlook on stressful situations or events can change your life.&nbsp; Every situation presents opportunities to learn and grow.&nbsp; The more you focus on the positive aspects of the situation, the more control you have over your stress reactions.<br><br><strong>3.5 Stress Journal</strong></p>
        <p>Keeping a stress journal helps you realize when you’re having a stress response.&nbsp; The earlier you identify your stress reactions, the sooner you can do something about them.&nbsp; Every time you feel stressed, stop and look closely at your situation.&nbsp; Then enter the following information into your stress journal.&nbsp;</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Where was I?</li>
        <li>What was going on around me?</li>
        <li>Who was I with?</li>
        <li>How could I have used more positive thinking and realistic self-talk to handle stress?</li>
        <li>Could I identify a negative thinking pattern? All-or-nothing thinking</li>
        <li>Exaggeration (catastrophizing)</li>
        <li>Overgeneralization</li>
        <li>Mind-reading</li>
        <li>What was I doing?</li>
        <li>What was I thinking?</li>
        <li>What was I saying to myself (self-talk)?</li>
        <li>What signs of stress was I having (physical, psychological, emotional)?</li>
        <li>On a scale of 0-10, how stressful was this situation?&nbsp; (Zero being as calm and relaxed as possible.&nbsp; Ten being severe stress and panic.</li>
        </ul><p><br><strong>3.6 Emotion-focused Strategies for Coping with Stress</strong></p>
        <p>Often we simply try to cope with stress without realizing we can change the situations and conditions that cause the stress.&nbsp; We <strong>DO</strong> have some control over the causes of stress in our lives.</p>
        <p><em><u>Some stressors can be eliminated or diminished easily. </u></em></p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: Milo has had a nagging toothache for a few weeks that is contributing to his stress and irritability.&nbsp; But he can choose to go to a dentist and take care of the problem.</p>
        <p><em><u>Some stressors can be controlled but the effort we have to expend is much greater.</u></em></p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: Maria needs to pass a course to get into mechanics training.&nbsp; She finds mechanics training difficult and is stressed that she won’t pass the course.&nbsp; But she can control her stress by studying more in her free time.</p>
        <p><em><u>Some stressful situations are simply out of our control.</u></em></p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: Lisa just found out she may have a serious illness.&nbsp; She must wait several days for lab results.&nbsp; Lisa has no control over the results or how long she must wait.&nbsp; To the right you will find strategies to help you overcome negative feelings cause by stress.</p>
        <p align="left"><br><u>Emotion-focused Strategies</u></p>
        <p>When faced with challenges outside your control try one of these strategies:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Listen to music</li>
        <li>Get together with a friend</li>
        <li>Read a book or watch a movie</li>
        <li>Get some physical exercise</li>
        <li>Engage in spiritual activities like prayer</li>
        <li>Try yoga</li>
        <li>Meditate</li>
        <li>Intake some humor</li>
        <li>Take a nap</li>
        <li>Write in a journal or diary</li>
        <li>Take a hot bath</li>
        <li>Help others in need</li>
        <li>Practice “anxiety surfing” (riding out anxieties until they naturally subside)</li>
        <li>Express you stress creatively (painting, playing a musical instrument)</li>
        <li>Take a “mental holiday” (go to the next page for more information about how to take a mental holiday anytime and at any place)</li>
        </ul><p><br><u>Tips For Taking A Mental Holiday</u></p>
        <p>You can use this technique almost any time in any place.&nbsp; Close your eyes and take 3 deep breaths.&nbsp; Imagine you are in a place where you have found peace in the past.&nbsp; Try involving all your senses.&nbsp; You may hear birds singing; feel the warmth of the sun on your shoulders, or smell sea salt.&nbsp; Engage all your senses and enjoy the sensations for a moment or two before returning to the here-and-now.</p>

        <p><u>Example</u>: &nbsp;<em>Max has recently returned from Iraq.&nbsp; He couldn’t wait to go home to his wife and son,&nbsp;but now that he is home, he feels anxious and irritable every night as he drives home from base.</em></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 2: </strong>Define the Problem</p>
        <p>Find the real problem and be specific about how it triggers your stress reaction.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max asks himself: “What is it about going home that makes me feel stressed?”&nbsp; He realizes his stress is related to his son’s poor performance at school and bad attitude at home.</em></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 3: </strong>Set a Goal</p>
        <p>Try to set a goal for how to respond in a way that reduces stress.</p>
        <p><em>Max knows he can’t control how other people act and that he can’t turn Max Jr. into a “perfect” son. But, as a father, Max does have some influence over his son.&nbsp; He decides to set specific, manageable goals, such as getting Max Jr. to spend more time on homework and help more around the house. Wait to go home to his wife and son, but now that he is home, he feels anxious and irritable every night as he drives home from base.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;<strong>STEP 4: </strong>Brainstorm Possible Solutions</p>
        <p>Get creative about possible solutions. When you brainstorm, don’t judge any of the solutions, just let them flow. Even if some ideas seem ridiculous, write them down. &nbsp;</p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max starts brainstorming the following solutions without judging them. </em><em>For instance,</em> g<em>round Max Jr. until he changes his attitude and does his homework; send Max Jr. to live with his grandmother; spend more quality time with Max Jr. and talk to him about problem solving; get a tutor for Max Jr.</em></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 5: &nbsp;</strong>Evaluate Possible Solutions</p>
        <p>Review the list of possible solutions and evaluate how well they may address the problem.</p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max makes a list of the pros and cons of each possible solution.</em></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 6: &nbsp;</strong>Choose the Best Solution Based on Pros and Cons</p>
        <p>Problem-solving experts suggest giving special considerations to the solution with the least cons. You may want to pick a second solution in case the first one does not work.</p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: &nbsp;<em>Max studies his list of pros and cons for each possible solution.&nbsp; He finds that the solution with the most pros and fewest cons is to spend more quality time with his son.&nbsp; His back-up solution is to hire a tutor to help Max Jr. with his homework.</em></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 7: &nbsp;</strong>Make a Plan and Try Your Solution</p>
        <p>Now create a specific plan to carry out your solution. You may need to divide the plan into steps.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max has decided on a possible solution and forms a plan.&nbsp; He will sit down with Max Jr. this weekend to make a list of the boy’s favorite things to do.&nbsp; Then they will create a plan for Max Jr. to earn some privileges by spending more time on homework and helping around the house.&nbsp; Max will also make himself available in the evenings to help his son with homework.</em></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 8: </strong>&nbsp;Assess the Solution’s Progress</p>
        <p>Reevaluate the situation and see how the actions have changed things.</p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>A month later, Max evaluates his solution by contacting Max Jr’s teachers and learns his son is improving in his schoolwork.&nbsp; He also sees that Max Jr. volunteers for more chores around the house.&nbsp; Max decides that he has met the goal he set for solving his problem.</em></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 9: </strong>&nbsp;If the First Solution Didn’t Work, Try Another!</p>
        <p>If your solution worked, your stress should diminish.&nbsp; If it didn’t work, try another solution from Step 5 until you find one that works.</p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max feels much less irritable and stressed now.&nbsp; In fact, he looks forward to coming home from work.&nbsp; He also knows if his first solution didn’t work, he could have tried his second solution of hiring a tutor</em></p>

      content : `
        <p>In this chapter, you will learn about drug and alcohol use and abuse.</p>
        <p><strong>1.1 Reasons for Using Drugs and Alcohol</strong></p>
        <ul><li>People often drink or use drugs to relax, celebrate, or socialize with others.&nbsp; But people may also use alcohol or drugs to:</li>
        <li>Help fall or stay asleep</li>
        <li>Manage stress and tension</li>
        <li>Numb emotional pain</li>
        <li>Ease physical pain</li>
        <li>"Drown out" worries</li>
        <li>Forget problems</li>
        <li>Decrease sadness</li>
        <li>Relax around others</li>
        <li>Avoid upsetting thoughts and memories</li>
        <li>“Take the edge of”</li>
        <li>Cope with depression</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>1.2 Drinking</strong></p>
        <p>Most service members keep their drinking under control.&nbsp; But excessive drinking can lead to relationship problems, work troubles, and financial or legal difficulties.</p>
        <p>Problem drinking can take different forms, including heavy drinking and binge drinking.&nbsp; People with a heavy drinking problem continue to drink even after serious consequences, like getting a DUI, getting fired, or destroying a marriage.&nbsp; Binge drinkers have five or more drinks at a time. Binge drinkers are 21 times more likely to damage property, get injured in accidents, act violently, have risky sex, drive drunk, or break the law.</p>
        <p><strong>1.3 Drug Use</strong></p>
        <p>Illegal drug use and prescription drug misuse are on the rise among service members.&nbsp; Nearly seven percent of service members report that they abuse illegal or prescription drugs.&nbsp; According to military substance use counselors, the most commonly abused drugs are marijuana, “uppers”</p>
        <p>(Methamphetamines and cocaine), and prescription painkillers (Vicodin and OxyContin).</p>
        <p>Misusing drugs can have severe consequences, like jail time or a dishonorable discharge.&nbsp; Even if they don’t get caught, few people use drugs in moderation.&nbsp; For most people, their drug use gets out of control and causes problems in many areas of life.</p>
        <p><u>Prescription Drug Use:</u></p>
        <p>In some cases, physicians prescribe pain medicine to service members for real problems, like a drug to control pain from an injury.&nbsp; These cases are harder to define as "misusing" or "abusing" drugs, because the medication was prescribed for a valid medical reason.&nbsp; But taking more medication than prescribed can become a serious problem.&nbsp; Some people use prescription medications to numb themselves or escape from stress and painful feelings.&nbsp; These drugs can also lead to depression, trouble thinking clearly, and addiction.&nbsp; Painkillers mixed with other drugs or alcohol can also lead to overdose or death.</p>
        <p>You may be abusing prescription drugs if you:</p>
        <ul><li>Take more medication than your physician prescribed</li>
        <li>Run out of the medication early</li>
        <li>Use the medication longer than prescribed</li>
        <li>Take the medication to get high or feel better emotionally</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>1.4 Substance Use Disorders</strong></p>
        <p>Substance use disorders can range in severity from mild to severe. The level of severity generally depends on how many symptoms occur. Presence of two to three symptoms indicates a mild disorder, four to five indicate a moderate disorder, and six or more symptoms indicate a severe disorder.</p>
        <ul><li>Headache</li>
        <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
        <li>Stomach pain</li>
        <li>Shakes or jitters</li>
        <li>Chills, sweats, or fevers</li>
        <li>Anxiety or panic attacks</li>
        <li>Hard time falling asleep</li>
        <li>Craving or strong desire to use the substance</li>
        <li>Difficulty controlling the amount of the substance used</li>
        <li>Difficulty stopping or decreasing use</li>
        <li>Spending a lot of time getting and using the substance, or getting over its effects</li>
        <li>Giving up important activities or responsibilities due to substance use</li>
        <li>Continuing to use substance, despite knowing the harm it can cause</li>
        <li>Having problems with family, friends, at school, or at work</li>
        <li>Being high or drunk in dangerous situations (such as while driving)Arguing or fighting with others while using</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Substance abuse is a pattern of use that includes one or more of the following in a twelve-month period:</p>
        <ul><li>Having problems with family, friends, at school, or at work</li>
        <li>Being high or drunk in dangerous situations (such as while driving)</li>
        <li>Getting into trouble with the law because of substance use</li>
        <li>Arguing or fighting with others while using</li>

        <p>Alcohol and drugs may seem to make things better.&nbsp; Substances may help you sleep, forget your problems, or feel more relaxed.&nbsp; But alcohol and drugs have substantial risks for your personal health, well-being and relationships.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>2.1 How Do You Know When There Is a Problem?</strong></p>
        <p>If you are concerned about a possible substance use problem, look for difficulties in these areas:</p>
        <ul><li>Work/School</li>
          <li>Mental Well-being</li>
          <li>Relationships</li>
          <li>Spirituality</li>
          <li>Family</li>
          <li>Self-respect</li>
          <li>Money</li>
          <li>Legal Record</li>
          <li>Physical Health</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you think you may have a drug or alcohol problem, ask yourself:</p>
        <ul><li>Have my family or friends commented on how much or how often I drink or use alcohol?</li>
          <li>Have I been feeling guilty about my drinking or drug use?</li>
          <li>Have I been drinking more or using more drugs over time?</li>
          <li>Have I tried unsuccessfully to cut down on alcohol or drugs?</li>
          <li>Do I use alone when I’m angry, sad, bored or lonely?</li>
          <li>So I use when I’m reminded of upsetting deployment memories?</li>
          <li>Does my using ever make me late for work?</li>
          <li>Does my family worry about my drinking or drug use?</li>
          <li>Do I ever use after telling myself I won’t?</li>
          <li>Have I ever forgotten what I did while drinking or using?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you answered "yes" to one or more of these questions, it may be time to look at how much you're using.&nbsp; Try cutting back with help from friends, family, community groups (like Alcoholics Anonymous/ Narcotics Anonymous) or a health care professional.</p>
        <p><strong>2.2 Common Excuses To Drink Or Use Drugs</strong></p>
        <p>Do any of these statements sound familiar; have you used any of them to explain your behavior to a friend or family member?</p>
        <ul><li>“At least I don’t use hard drugs”</li>
          <li>“I can control myself if I want to; I just don’t want to!”</li>
          <li>“I only drink beer (wine), and everyone else does it.”</li>
          <li>“I’ve never missed a day of work (or school).”</li>
          <li>“I’m not an alcoholic– alcoholics drink all day, every day.”</li>
          <li>“I don’t need help, I can handle it myself.”</li>
          <li>“I gave it up for 3 weeks last year so I’m fine.”</li>
          <li>“Sure, I drink a lot, but I can stop whenever I want.”</li>
          <li>“I don't’ drink every day.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>2.3 Substance Use and Relationships</strong></p>
        <p>It's hard to have healthy relationships if you regularly get drunk or high.&nbsp; Here’s a list of relationship problems caused by substance abuse:</p>
        <ul><li>Fighting and arguments</li>
          <li>Loved ones feel rejected by someone who’s always drunk or high</li>
          <li>Secrets and lies that damage trust and intimacy</li>
          <li>Poor choices that affect loved ones and cause them worry</li>
          <li>Communication problems</li>
          <li>Children confused and hurt by aggressive behavior, emotional distance, or inconsistency</li>
          <li>Families affected by accidents and arrests</li>
          <li>Family violence and accidents</li>
          <li>Higher risk of driving under the influence with family members in the car</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>2.4 How To Tell If You’re Having Problems With Alcohol</strong></p>
        <p>Some people find drinking more relieves stress - have you noticed this in yourself?&nbsp; If so, try to get a sense of whether your pattern of drinking is dangerous or causing problems.&nbsp; Answer these questions honestly–they’re meant to help you assess your drinking.&nbsp; Then score your answers.&nbsp; You may want to print or write these questions out.</p>
        <p><strong>Quantity-Frequency Measure:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>On average, how many days during the week do you drink?</li>
          <li>On a typical day when you drink, how many drinks do you have?</li>
          <li>Multiply the first number by the second number</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How&nbsp;To Measure Your Score:</strong> Sgt. Jones says he drinks a six-pack of beer on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights.&nbsp; This is 3 days a week, with 6 drinks on each day.&nbsp; To calculate the score, we multiply 3 x 6 to get a score of 18.</p>
        <p><u>Your substance use could be a problem if </u></p>
        <ul>
          <li>You are a Man and your score is 14 or more</li>
          <li>You are a woman and your score is 7 or more</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The number for women is lower because their bodies have a lower percentage of water<br>than men's bodies, less of the enzyme that breaks down alcohol, and a different hormonal<br>make-up.&nbsp; As a result, alcohol remains concentrated in a woman's body longer than in a<br>man’s body.</p>
        <p>If your score indicates your drinking may be a problem, ask yourself these <strong>CAGE</strong> questions:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Over the past year…</p>
        <p><strong>C </strong>- Have you felt you should CUT down on your drinking or drug use?</p>
        <p><strong>A </strong>- Have people ANNOYED you by criticizing your drinking or drug use?</p>
        <p><strong>G</strong> - Have you ever felt GUILTY about your drinking or drug use?</p>
        <p><strong>E</strong> - Have you ever had an “eye-opener” – you drank or used drugs first thing in the morning to “steady your nerves?”</p>
        <p>If you answered yes to 1 or 2 of the CAGE questions might be experiencing alcohol abuse.&nbsp; If you answered yes to 3 or 4 of the CAGE questions, you might be experiencing alcohol dependence.</p>
        <p>If your score on the quantity-frequency measure was more than 14 for men, or 7 for women, and you answered yes to three or four of the CAGE questions, it’s likely you are experiencing substance dependence.&nbsp; Substance dependence is serious.&nbsp; It can affect your mood, functioning at work, relationships, health and more.&nbsp; Substance dependence requires professional help (see Services to Help You Quit section of this chapter).</p>
        <p>If your score on the quantity-frequency measure was more than 14 for men, or 7 for women, and you answered yes to one or two of the CAGE questions, it’s likely you are experiencing substance abuse.&nbsp; Substance abuse can affect your work, your relationships, your emotions, and your health.&nbsp; It can also lead to substance dependence, so you should talk about your drinking with a healthcare professional while you still have control.&nbsp; See the Services to Help You Quit section of this chapter.</p>

      title : '3.0 Substance Use and Post-Traumatic Stress',
      content : `
        <p>There is a strong link between traumatic events and substance use problems.&nbsp; Many trauma survivors use alcohol or drugs to relieve stress, depression, and upsetting memories. Using substances to AVOID can actually make things worse not better. Struggling to cope with a traumatic event doesn’t always lead to problems with alcohol or drugs.&nbsp; However, service members who experienced combat and other traumatic events are more likely to have problems with alcohol and drugs.&nbsp; These substances make it more difficult to deal with stress and trauma.</p>
        <p><strong>3.1 Post-Traumatic Stress Reactions</strong></p>
        <p>Combat stress, or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), is a set of emotional challenges that occur after someone has been through a traumatic or stressful event.</p>
        <p><strong>There are four main types of Post-Traumatic Stress reactions:</strong></p>
        <ol><li><strong>Re-experiencing the trauma: </strong>Flashbacks, nightmares, memories you can't erase, or intense emotional and physical reactions to trauma reminders (being triggered)</li>
        <li><strong>Negative changes in mood and thoughts</strong>: Always thinking that the world, other people or oneself are entirely bad or dangerous, lost interest in things, feeling detached from others, or unable to feel positively about oneself or others.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoidance</strong>: Avoiding activities, people, or places that remind you of the trauma; avoiding talking or thinking about the trauma.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased arousal</strong>: Having a hard time sleeping and concentrating, being irritable, on guard and "jumpy," or having intense responses to being startled (hitting the dirt).</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>3.2 Drinking and Using Drugs To Cope With Combat Stress</strong></p>
        <p>To cope with these challenging reactions, service members often turn to substances to "self-medicate."&nbsp; But alcohol or drugs only provide <em>temporary</em> relief to painful memories and feelings.&nbsp; And those<br>substances produce a lot of downsides:</p>

        </tr></tbody></table>
        <p><strong>3.3&nbsp;Breaking the Connection</strong></p>
        <p>Some service members think, "I'm not willing to cut back right now, I just want to focus on getting rid of my combat stress."&nbsp; Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.&nbsp; Substance use affects combat stress, and combat stress can lead to substance abuse, so don’t ignore the link between the two.</p>
        <p><strong>3.4&nbsp;Sleep Problems and Substance Abuse</strong></p>
        <p>Many Service Members who have combat stress reactions also have the following sleep problems:</p>
        <ul><li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Trouble falling asleep</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Waking up often</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Restless sleep</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Nightmares</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Substances may help you fall asleep or avoid nightmares, but they may also make you more irritable and “on guard.”&nbsp; Drinking or smoking pot often makes it harder to get a restful night's sleep.&nbsp; Alcohol may help you fall asleep, but it prevents you from getting restful sleep.&nbsp; As the alcohol wears off, the body wakes up over and over again during the night.&nbsp; This contributes to feeling hung over, tired and irritable the next day. Using these substances to AVOID your feelings prevents healing and can make it worse, and can contribute to developing PTSD.</p>
        <p><strong>3.5&nbsp;Developing Healthy Coping Skills</strong></p>
        <p>Your reactions may seem worse and more intense when you don't have substances to numb your feelings.&nbsp; So you need an arsenal of coping skills to deal with your PTSD or combat stress reactions <em>without</em> using drugs or alcohol.&nbsp; You can:</p>
        <ul><li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Practice relaxation exercises or slow, relaxing breathing.</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Learn other stress management skills.</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Fill your schedule with fun activities that don’t involve drinking or using drugs.</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Talk to a trusted friend or family member.</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Learn anger management skills, like taking a timeout or assertive communication.</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Develop healthy bedtime habits and routines.</li>

        <p>In this section, you will learn how to make healthy choices about alcohol and drugs by learning about moderate drinking, tips for safe drinking, and the effects of your blood alcohol concentration.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>4.1&nbsp; What is Moderate Drinking?</strong></p>
        <p>It is important to know how much drinking is too much, or "when to say when."&nbsp; For most adults, consuming a moderate amount of alcohol is not harmful and will not lead to alcohol-related problems. Moderate alcohol use means:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Up to two drinks per day for men</li>
        <li>Up to one drink per day for women</li>
        <li>Up to one drink per day for older adults</li>
        </ul><p><br>One drink means:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>A 12-ounce bottle of beer</li>
        <li>A 5-ounce glass of wine</li>
        <li>1.5 ounces of 80 proof distilled liquor</li>
        </ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Moderate alcohol use is <em><u>not</u></em> safe for everyone.</p>
        <p>Here are some ideas of things you can say when you choose to refuse a drink:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>“I’m driving.”</li>
        <li>“No, thanks.”</li>
        <li>“I have something to do in the morning.”</li>
        <li>“I’m training for a marathon/triathlon/other sporting event.”</li>
        <li>“I drank too much last night so I’m taking it easy tonight.”</li>
        <li>“I’m taking a break from drinking for a couple of weeks.”</li>
        <li>“I have too much work to do in the morning.”</li>
        <li>“I’m allergic to alcohol.”</li>
        <li>“If I have another one, I’ll fall asleep."&nbsp;</li>
        <li>"I’ll get a coffee or a soda instead.”</li>
        <li>“I have an important meeting tomorrow.”</li>
        <li>“I’m OK for now.” (Keep a half-filled cup even if you’re not drinking)</li>
        <li>“I’m taking medication that I can’t mix with alcohol.”</li>
        <li>“I’m trying to lose weight.”</li>
        <li>“I had a migraine headache earlier.”</li>
        <li>"I'm pregnant.”</li>
        <li>“Thanks but I’ve already had enough to drink tonight.”</li>
        <li><strong>“</strong>Sorry, I never drink on Mondays.” (Tues, Weds, and so forth)</li>
        <li>“No thanks. My liver is tired.”</li>
        <li>“I’m under the weather today.”</li>
        <li>“I don’t feel like praying to the porcelain god tonight.”</li>
        <li>“I have a bet with someone to see how long I can go without drinking.”</li>
        <li>“I already had a six-pack!”</li>
        </ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>4.2 Putting Moderate Drinking Into Action</strong></p>
        <p>To keep your drinking within moderate levels, you might:<br>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Think of three reasons to drink moderately before you go out.</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>I want to wake up early.</li>
        <li>I want to exercise in the morning.</li>
        <li>My girlfriend/boyfriend doesn't like it when I drink.</li>
        </ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Make a plan:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Bring enough money for only a couple of drinks; leave your creit cards home</li>
        <li>Decide ahead of time how many drinks you will have.</li>
        <li>Decide how you’ll get home <em>safely</em>.</li>
        <li>Commit to going home at a certain time.</li>
        </ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While you’re out, call someone who cares about you.</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Ask them to remind you why you decided to drink moderately.</li>
        </ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Drink non-alcoholic drinks, or alternate between alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Drink a lot of water.</li>
        <li>Order some food.</li>
        </ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For some people, it is hard to imagine having fun without alcohol. But there are lots of ways to have fun when other people are drinking and you are not:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Play bartender or DJ.</li>
        <li>Watch a movie.</li>
        <li>Start up a game of pool, darts, cards, or a video game.</li>
        <li>Find other non-drunk people.&nbsp; You might make new friends.</li>
        <li>Pretend to be drunk - your drunk friends won't know the difference.</li>
        <li>Play drinking games with non-alcoholic drinks.</li>
        <li>Take funny pictures of your friends.</li>
        </ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>4.3 Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)</strong></p>
        <p>Blood Alcohol Concentration, or BAC, is the amount of alcohol in your blood at any given time, which determines the effects that alcohol has on you.</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>A BAC of .10 is enough to be considered <em>legally drunk</em>.</li>
        <li>The legal level for driving drunk in most states is .08.</li>
        <li>Bodies burn or metabolize alcohol at a steady rate.</li>
        <li>You can’t dilute alcohol in your system with nonalcoholic drinks or food.</li>
        <li>The only thing that lowers your BAC is <em>time</em>.</li>
        <li>The faster someone drinks, the higher their BAC rises.</li>
        <li>Other things that affect BAC:</li>
        <li>Gender (Women's BAC increases more quickly)</li>
        <li>Weight</li>
        <li>Metabolism</li>
        <li>Use of medication<br type="_moz"><br>&nbsp;</li>

        <p><strong>4.6&nbsp; Tips For Getting Home Safely</strong></p>
        <p>Here are some tips for getting home safely after a night out:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><strong>Plan ahead.&nbsp; </strong>Have a solid plan in place before you start drinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Designate a driver.</strong>&nbsp; Decide beforehand who the non-drinking driver will be. Choose someone reliable. Pay for their non-alcoholic drinks and their gas.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep taxi numbers and money handy.</strong> Take a couple of cab company phone numbers and cab fare money with you.&nbsp; Put the money in a place where you are sure not to spend it on something else.</li>
        <li><strong>Public transportation/Local transportation.&nbsp; </strong>Before you go out, look up late night public transportation times and stash some money away for the fare. Some cities also have cheap late night transportation options to get people home safely.</li>
        <li><strong>Plan to walk home.&nbsp; </strong>Sometimes walking home can be a great idea. Be sure to walk with someone else, and stay in well-lit areas. Don't let your friends wander off alone, especially when they are drunk.</li>
        <li><strong>Get a hotel room or stay with a friend.</strong></li>
        </ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>4.7&nbsp; Caring For A Friend Who Has Had Too Much To Drink</strong></p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><strong>Know the warning signs.</strong>&nbsp; If you see your friends talking loudly, slurring their speech, getting excitable or aggressive, wobbling or weaving, or feeling nauseous, step in and help.</li>
        <li><strong>Make them aware that they are drunk.&nbsp; </strong>Pull them aside, express your concern, and suggest they stop or slow their drinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Help your friend get home.&nbsp; </strong>Don't let your friend stumble off alone, even if they tell you they can manage on their own.&nbsp; Stick together, keep your friend walking, and decide if food will help.&nbsp; Food helps someone who is tipsy, not someone who is drunk and may get sick.</li>
        <li><strong>Walk or get a taxi.&nbsp; </strong>Fresh air and a walk often help people stay alert.&nbsp; Consider if walking back home is safe.&nbsp; If your friend is wobbly on their feet or is loud and obnoxious, call a cab.&nbsp; In the cab, keep the windows rolled down.&nbsp; Ask the driver to stop if you think your friend may throw up.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't leave them on their doorstep!&nbsp; </strong>Once you reach your destination, don't leave your friend alone. If your friend lives with someone, let that person know the situation. If your friend lives alone, consider staying the night. Make sure your friend sleeps on the side or stomach in case of vomiting.</li>
        <li><strong>Really worried? Get help.&nbsp; </strong>Call an ambulance or go directly to the emergency room if you are worried about your friend blacking out, passing out, or having a seizure.</li>
        </ul>

      title : '5.0 Abstinence: When Safe Use Is No Use',
      content : `
      <p>Some people should seriously consider quitting drugs or alcohol altogether when:</p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Alcohol/Drugs control you.&nbsp; Some people find it hard to control their drinking or drug use.&nbsp; The drinking or using drugs controls the person, rather than the other way around.&nbsp; If this sounds like you, the best strategy is to completely avoid alcohol and drugs.</li>
      <li>You have chronic problems in relationships such as:
      <ul><li>Exposing loved ones to violence or harm</li>
      <li>Avoiding or distancing emotionally from family</li>
      <li>Hurting family finances by spending too much money on alcohol or drugs<br>&nbsp;</li>
      </ul></li>
      </ul><p>Some service members are motivated to quit when family members confront them about their drinking/using.&nbsp; Others quit on their own to try and repair damaged relationships.<br><br>If you use illegal drugs, STOP!&nbsp; You are risking your health, military career, your relationships, and your legal record.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>5.1 Staying “Clean”</strong></p>
      <p>If you decide to stop drinking or using, you will notice some continued cravings or thoughts about alcohol and drugs.&nbsp; People, places, objects, feelings, and times can cause these thoughts and cravings. These are called <strong><em>triggers.</em></strong>&nbsp; For example, if you're used to going out to drink with friends on Friday nights, your personal triggers could be:</p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Friday night</li>
      <li>After work</li>
      <li>Friends who drink<br>&nbsp;</li>
      </ul><p>Triggers can cause you to use again. Your brain may also give you permission to drink or use, also known as <strong><em>relapse justification</em></strong>. One side of your brain may say its okay to drink or use, while the other side of your brain says to stay sober. Even this mental argument can lead to drug and alcohol use.<br><br>Cravings are not always easy to detect. Thoughts and cravings may pass through your mind unnoticed. It takes work to identify and stop a thought. But the more you think about using drugs or alcohol, the more likely you will start drinking or using again. This is called a "relapse."</p>
      <p>Triggers, thoughts, cravings, and using all seem to get tangled together.&nbsp; To help you understand addiction, the usual sequence goes like this:<br>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">Trigger Thoughts =&gt; Craving =&gt; Drink/Use</span></strong></span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>5.2&nbsp;Identifying Triggers</strong></p>
      <p>Triggers that make you want to use alcohol or drugs can be <strong>external</strong>, such as activities, events, or situations.&nbsp; Triggers can also be <strong>internal</strong>, such as negative thoughts or feelings.<br><br>External Triggers</p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>When home alone</li>
      <li>When with friends</li>
      <li>At parties</li>
      <li>At sporting events</li>
      <li>At the movies</li>
      <li>At bars or clubs</li>
      <li>At the beach</li>
      <li>At the park</li>
      <li>At concerts</li>
      <li>Before or during date</li>
      <li>Before or after sex</li>
      <li>Before after work</li>
      <li>With a meal</li>
      <li>After a pay day</li>
      <li>While driving</li>
      <li>At school</li>
      <li>After going past a liquor store or your dealer's residence</li>
      <li>When with friends who drink or use drugs<br type="_moz"><br>&nbsp;</li>
      </ul><p>Internal Triggers</p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Fear</li>
      <li>Frustration</li>
      <li>Anger</li>
      <li>Loneliness</li>

      <li>Nervousness</li>
      <li>Confidence</li>
      <li>Happiness</li>
      <li>Feeling pressured</li>
      <li>Depression</li>
      <li>Insecurity</li>
      <li>Relaxation</li>
      <li>Embarrassment</li>
      <li>Irritation</li>
      <li>Sadness</li>
      <li>Excitement</li>
      <li>Jealousy</li>
      <li>Boredom</li>
      <li>Fatigue<br>&nbsp;</li>
      </ul><p>Other Internal Triggers</p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Talking about an upsetting employment experience&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Watching the news</li>
      <li>Being reminded of deployment experiences</li>
      <li>Having a nightmare</li>
      <li>Reacting to combat stress reactions</li>
      <li>Having trouble concentrating</li>
      <li>Having trouble sleeping because of combat stress</li>
      <li>Feeling irritable after being reminded of deployment expriences</li>
      </ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>5.3&nbsp;How Can I Have Fun If I Don’t Drink or Use?</strong></p>
      <p>Learn to combat boredom and loneliness, because these feelings trigger urges to drink or use.&nbsp; To fight boredom and loneliness:</p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><strong>Go to church, synagogue, mosque or temple:</strong> Joining a place of worship helps you find community, new relationships, and spiritual direction.</li>
      <li><strong>Work out: </strong>Take a class at a local gym or community center.&nbsp; Try a new sport or physical activity, or a martial art.&nbsp; Or join a sports league or hiking group.</li>
      <li><strong>Start or re-start a hobby: </strong>Find a group nearby with similar interests, whether it's music, motorcycles, reading, cooking, or travel.</li>
      <li><strong>Meet for a Meal:</strong> Invite someone to have breakfast, lunch or dinner. &nbsp;Cook for your friends one week, and then ask your friends to cook for you the following week.</li>
      <li><strong>Join a professional group or a neighborhood organization:&nbsp; </strong>You might also join groups based on a professional interest, or volunteer in your local community.</li>
      <li><strong>Take a class:</strong> Expand your horizons by learning an instrument or taking a college or community education course.</li>
      <li><strong>Join a Veterans organization:</strong> Groups such as the American Legion or Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) can give you a place to socialize with others who've served. You can join these groups even while on active duty.</li>
      <li><strong>Volunteer:</strong> Cleaning up a local park, volunteering at a hospital or doing a walkathon can provide a great way to bond with others.</li>
      <li><strong>Be an involved neighbor:</strong> Helping a neighbor with a garden or home maintenance project can be another way to develop relationships.</li>
      <li><strong>Join a cause: </strong>Get together with a group of people working toward a goal you believe in, such as an election or the preservation of a natural area.</li>

      <p><strong>6.2&nbsp; Getting Help For Both Substance Use And Combat Stress/PTSD</strong></p>
      <p>If you have Post-Traumatic Stress, find a professional who works with substance use problems <em>and</em> PTSD. Many VA hospitals offer support and treatment. Contact your local VA hospital or Vet Center for information about programs that work with substance use and combat stress problems. Schedule an appointment with a counselor. They will ask many questions about your substance use (including alcohol, drugs, and prescription medication). The two of you will also discuss the ways that substance use affects your combat stress or PTSD. If you are a service member, each service provides support services that will help you with substance abuse and combat stress/PTSD.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Other common treatment options:</strong></p>
      <ul><li>Education</li>
      <li>Individual therapy</li>
      <li>Group therapy</li>
      <li>Support groups</li>
      <li>Alcoholics Anonymous / Narcotics Anonymous</li>
      </ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Working on issues of PTSD and substance abuse at the same time isn’t easy. Your Post-Traumatic Stress reactions may get worse when you first stop drinking or using,. Substance abuse can cause sleep and relationship problems, which make PTSD worse. So working on both issues at the same time is more effective than working on them separately.</p>

      <p>Besides therapy, medications can help you stop drinking.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Antabuse</strong> treats alcoholism.&nbsp; Antabuse makes people feel sick when they drink.&nbsp; Over time, they associate feeling sick with drinking. It's called "aversion therapy."</p>
      <p><strong>Naltrexone</strong> is a newer medication to treat alcoholism.&nbsp; It is not aversion therapy, but it can help curb cravings. &nbsp;Naltrexone is not effective for everyone.&nbsp; Talk to your health care provider about it.</p>
      <p>Other medications treat both PTSD and alcoholism.&nbsp; Antidepressants like Paxil and Zoloft may reduce alcohol use in people who also have PTSD.&nbsp; When some people take Naltrexone and an antidepressant, the combination helps reduce drinking more than taking each medication alone.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>6.7 Willing to Cut Back, But Not Quit Entirely?</strong></p>
      <ul><li>Write down reasons to limit your drinking or use (family, social, legal, work, etc).</li>
      <li>Set a drinking goal. Choose not to drink at all or stay within safe drinking limits.&nbsp; Write this goal on a piece of paper and put it in a place you will easily see.</li>
      <li>Keep a use journal. Include when, where, what, and how much you use in a week.</li>
      <li>Keep only a limited amount of alcohol (or drugs) at home.</li>
      <li>Take one-hour breaks between drinks.</li>
      <li>Alternate between non-alcoholic drinks and alcoholic drinks.</li>
      <li>Avoid rounds or 'shots.'</li>
      <li>Have one drink at a time and keep track of your drinks-avoid 'topping.'</li>
      <li>Limit mixed drinks. They often hide the taste of alcohol, but not the effects.</li>
      <li>Drink slowly. Take sips, not gulps.</li>
      <li>Eat food when drinking alcohol.</li>
      <li>Pick one or more days of the week to not drink at all, and then pick a full week.</li>
      <li>Practice ways to say “no” when offered a drink (or other substance). Use the phrases on the <strong><em>Ways to Refuse a Drink</em></strong> list in our <strong>Expert Advice</strong> section.</li>
      <li>Avoid people who criticize your decision not to use.</li>
      <li>Be aware of your triggers and avoid them. If you can’t avoid them, plan ahead with strategies to resist temptation.</li>
      <li>Avoid drinking when angry, upset, or after a bad day.</li>
      <li>Stay busy - don't just sit around and drink.</li>
      <li>Be assertive - don't be pressured into drinking.</li>
      <li>Get help from family, friends, a healthcare provider, church member, and/or self-help group like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).</li>
      <li>Don't give up; it may take several attempts to make healthy changes to your substance use habits.</li>

      title : '1.0 - Returning Home After a Deployment',
      content : `
        <p>Now that you’re at home, you may feel and act differently than you did before deployments.  Your family and friends may have changed too.  This is common and normal.  You may find it hard to reconnect with loved ones and wonder if things well ever get back to “normal”. </p>
        <p>Are any of these common post-deployment issues a problem for you?</p>
        <ul><li>I’m less interested in activities I used to enjoy</li>
        <li>I’m having a hard time trusting others</li>
        <li>I need to be in control of my emotions all the time</li>
        <li>I don’t want to talk about what happened in the war zone</li>
        <li>I’m having a hard time with face-to-face communications</li>
        <li>I have less interest in sexual activity</li>
        <li>I’m confused about my role at home</li>
        <li>I’m having a hard time talking with my kids</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>1.2 Improving Family Relationships</strong></p>
        <p>After a long separation, it’s common to have tensions and disagreements as you get reconnected.  A great way to reconnect with the family is to find out what happened while you were away.  Then you can tell them about the positive things that happened during your deployment. </p>
        <p>Try these tips for reconnecting with family and friends:</p>
        <ul><li>Go to a sporting event, concert or a movie together</li>
        <li>Take a walk, hike, or a bike ride together</li>
        <li>Talk about your experience living in a different country</li>
        <li>Make a scrapbook of photo album of your lives together, with your deployments as one chapter in a larger story</li>
        <li>Ask your family what they did while you were gone, you might ask:
        <ul><li>“What were the best movies you saw?”</li>
        <li>“What music have you been listening to?”</li>
        <li>“Anything cool happen at work/school?”</li>
        <li>“What funny things have the kids done lately?”</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>1.3 Pay Attention to Positives</strong></p>
        <p>As you readjust to life with your family, it’s easy to focus on the bad instead of the good.  Do your best to notice the positive things family members do for you.</p>
        <ul ><li>Your partner bringing you a snack while you watch T.V.</li>
        <li>Your daughter drawing you a picture.</li>
        <li>Your mom offering to watch the kids so you can spend some “alone” time with your partner.</li>
        <li>Your son cleaning up his room without being told.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Noticing the small positives in life helps you feel better and your loved ones feel appreciated.  It’s also good to tell people you appreciate their behavior: "Thanks, I really appreciate how much you've helped me with this chore."</p>
        <p><strong>1.4 Talking About Deployment</strong></p>
        <p>Some service members just want to put their deployment experiences behind them.  But talking about those experiences with your family helps everyone.  Keep in mind that talking about your experiences doesn’t mean you have to tell people everything.  Here are suggestions for talking about your deployment without going into too much detail:</p>
        <ul><li>“I saw and did some really intense things that are hard for me to talk about.  Thanks for your patience.”</li>
        <li>“Sometimes my memories make me space out and I have a hard time concentrating.</li>
        <li>"I need you to just listen sometimes, and not interrupt me.”</li>
        <li>“I might need a few minutes to calm down—thanks for giving me some space.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your family may need support because they may be worried or upset about what happened to you.</p>
        <ul><li>Telling them what deployment was like for you.</li>
        <li>Telling them which deployment memories affect you now.</li>
        <li>Explaining that reminders of your deployment may make you distracted or tense.</li>
        <li>Reminding them how much you care about them.</li>
        <li>Enjoying fun activities together.</li>
        <li>Listening to them with an open mind, even when you have a different opinion.</li>
        <li>Acknowledging their feelings, “I know that this is hard for you too.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>1.5 Handling Conflict</strong></p>
        <p>Arguments can make it hard to talk to your partner about deployments.  It’s important to discuss problems in a way that builds up the relationship instead of tearing it down.  Here are some ideas for handling conflicts with a family member:</p>
        <ul><li><strong>Plan ahead. </strong> Schedule time to discuss the problem.  This gives both of you time to think about what to say.  Find a time when you can talk without distractions.</li>
        <li><strong>Identify your goal.  </strong>If your goal is to "win" the argument, your relationship will suffer.  Seek an outcome that will satisfy you both.  This usually requires compromises from both partners.</li>
        <li><strong>"I" Statements.  </strong>When you bring up an issue, don’t blame the other person.  Blame makes people defensive.  Instead, use “I” statements, telling the other person how you feel.</li>
        </ul><p >Instead of saying, "you never listen to me," say, "I feel frustrated when you read the newspaper while I’m talking."</p>
        <p >Instead of saying "That's ridiculous!" say, "I don't understand what you mean. Can you explain it again?"</p>
        <ul ><li><strong>Stick to one topic.  </strong>Bring up a specific issue that happened.  Tell the other person exactly what happened and why it bothered you.  Focus on resolving the issue, instead of bringing up other things.  Avoid saying "always” or “never”.</li>
        </ul><p >Instead of saying "You always nag me!" say, "Sometimes I need a few minutes to unwind after work."</p>
        <ul ><li><strong>Stay calm: </strong>When you get upset, you're less likely to think clearly, and you're more likely to say things that don't help the situation.  Stay calm, and you'll be better able to solve the problem.</li>
        </ul><p >To stay calm, take breaks during the discussion.  Practice relaxing by counting to 10, breathing slowly, or taking a brief walk to relieve tension.</p>
        <p >Be sure to tell your partner if you need a short break from the conversation so it doesn't seem like you're walking away.</p>
        <ul><li><strong>No "below the belt"</strong> <strong>shots</strong>.  Shouting, name-calling, foul language, threats, and sarcasm usually make arguments worse and make it harder to find common ground.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>1.6 Approaches That Do “More Harm Than Good”</strong></p>
        <p>Avoid <strong>criticizing</strong> and <strong>lashing out</strong> in anger during arguments.  Trying to control a conversation by demanding that others respond in a certain way won’t get you good results.  Finally, don’t expect others to solve problems for you<strong>.</strong>  You need to help find the solution.</p>
        <p><strong>1.7 Your Communication Plan</strong></p>
        <ul><li>Develop a "Communication Plan" to talk about deployment with your family. </li>
        <li>Decide ahead of time what you want to discuss.</li>
        <li>Share a little at a time, and then let the other person respond.</li>
        <li>Learn to endure painful feelings so you don't lash out while sharing.</li>
        <li>Listen without interrupting or getting defensive.</li>
        <li>Ask for feedback.</li>
        <li>Ask the other person to share their own feelings, experiences, and ways of coping.</li>
        <li>Own up to your feelings and behavior – don't blame others for how you feel.</li>
        </ul>

      content : `
        <p>After challenging and potentially life changing experiences like deployment, you may find that you want to spend time alone.  It’s natural to want some time to yourself.  If you had an intense combat experience (like being injured or witnessing a death of a friend), it may be difficult to get close to other people right now.  Or you may prefer to spend time only with “battle buddies”, avoiding friends who don’t share your deployment experiences.  These are all normal and common feelings held by many service members returning from deployment.</p>
        <p>There’s nothing wrong with spending some time alone, but isolating yourself from others can become a bad habit. To reconnect with your friends and community, we recommend that you work through the following sections in order:</p>
        <ol ><li>Overcome isolation</li>
        <li>Strengthen your network of relationships</li>
        <li>Share your deployment experiences</li>
        <li>Manage problem situations</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>2.1 Overcoming Isolation</strong></p>
        <p>After an intense experience like deployment, you may feel awkward and lonely around others.  You might keep to yourself because it allows you to avoid situations that bring up painful feelings or memories.  But if you cut yourself off from your friends, you won’t get the support you need and deserve.  Avoiding people can actually increase those upsetting thoughts and feelings.</p>
        <p><strong>2.2 Tips For Beating Isolation</strong></p>
        <p>You may have to push yourself to spend time with others. Remember that being around others is important for your well-being.</p>
        <ul ><li>Be intentional.  Plan to socialize with others.  Stick to your plan even when you’d rather be alone.</li>
        <li>Spend time with people you trust, in places where you are comfortable.</li>
        <li>Start with short outings, staying a little longer each time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>2.3 Strengthening Your Network</strong></p>
        <p>Returning service members often think they have little in common with their family and friends back home.  After such an intense, life-changing experience, you may think no one understands you.  But connecting with others helps you:</p>
        <ul ><li>Improve your mood</li>
        <li>Decrease your boredom</li>
        <li>Deal with painful thoughts and feelings about your deployment</li>
        <li>Find solutions to your problems</li>
        <li>Avoid harmful coping methods (like heavy drinking)</li>
        <li>REALIZE you are not alone<br type="_moz" /><br /> </li>
        </ul><p>It's important to strengthen your social network in the months following a deployment.  Some people like having a large and mixed social network.  Others prefer a smaller circle of friends.  Either way, it helps to have people you can count on when you need them.  Your social network includes:</p>
        <ul ><li>Family members and friends</li>
        <li>Neighbors</li>
        <li>Co-workers</li>
        <li>Community members such as members of church or sports league</li>
        <li>Professionals such as counselors, therapists and doctors</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>2.4 Expanding Your Network</strong></p>
        <p>Being with others gives you a sense of belonging and security, lifts your spirits, and eases your worries.  Don’t forget, you may be a source of comfort and friendship for others, too! </p>
        <p>Here are some things you can do to be part of your community and increase your social support network:</p>
        <ul ><li>Get some exercise.  Join a pick-up game.  Take and exercise class at a local gym or community center. Sports leagues and hiking groups are great ways to meet people while staying fit.  You could also try a new sport of physical activity.</li>
        <li>Get a hobby.  Find local people who share your interest in music, motorcycles, professional sports, cooking, and books</li>
        <li>Join a place of worship.  Joining a church, synagogue, mosque or temple can give you spiritual directions and help you become part of the community</li>
        <li>Join a professional group or neighborhood organization.  Get involved in a Neighborhood Watch group, or a group based on professional interests</li>
        <li>Volunteer.  Get involved in community service projects—clean up a local park or volunteer at a hospital</li>
        <li>Join a veteran's organization.  Groups such as the VA, the American Legion, and Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) are safe places to talk and fit in.  You’re probably eligible to join these groups, even if you’re currently active duty</li>
        <li>Join a cause.  Work with others toward a goal you believe in, such as an election or the protection of a natural area</li>
        </ul>

      content : `
        <p>Talking about your intense deployment experience can ease the impact of it.  Opening up about your deployment can be hard, so choose people who you trust to help and support you.  Friends, family members, chaplains, counselors and therapists can all provide support.</p>
        <p><strong>3.1 Sharing Your Deployment Experiences</strong></p>
        <p>The excuses listed are common and understandable.  You may need to coach yourself with self-talk. <br /><br />Below are positive ways to deal with these common excuses:</p>
        <p><strong>“I don’t want to be a burden.”</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Remember: People who care about you don’t see your problems as a burden.</li>
        <li>Ask yourself: “How do <em>I </em>feel when a close friend talks to me about something that bothers them?”</li>
        <li>Work through the most upsetting stuff together.<br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>“I think I should be over it by now.”</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Remember it takes time to heal.</li>
        <li>Looking for support can help you recover more quickly.</li>
        <li>Judging and criticizing yourself isn’t helpful and may make recovery harder.<br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>“I don’t want to be teased or made fun of.”</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Talk to someone you trust.</li>
        <li>Agree to keep the conversation private.<br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>“I’m afraid I’ll get so upset that I’ll lose control.”</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Go at your own pace and take breaks when you need to calm down.</li>
        <li>Practice your new relaxation skills when you’re upset<strong>.</strong><br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>“I don’t think it will be helpful.”</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Talk to someone to examine your own feelings.</li>
        <li>Facing your fears is healthier than avoiding them.<br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>“I think asking for help means I’m weak or going crazy.”</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Everyone needs support from time to time.</li>
        <li>Getting help shows strength, courage, and self-respect.</li>
        <li>Talking about things can be hard, but in the end you’ll feel better and stronger.<br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>“I don’t think anyone can understand.”</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Only if you <em>never</em> give anyone the chance to understand.</li>
        <li>You’re not alone; others have been through similar experiences.</li>
        <li>Ask others how they handle stressful experiences in their lives.</li>
        <li>Talk to a professional, such as psychologist or support group.<br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>“I’m worried that talking about it may affect my military career.”</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Talk to other service members with similar experiences.</li>
        <li>Agree to keep the conversation private.</li>
        <li>Know that in most cases, talking about your problems will help you overcome them.  But be aware that sharing some information could impact your career.  So share with someone you trust.<br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>“I think people might reject me if they know what I did during deployment.”</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Talk to other service members first, and then share with others you trust.</li>
        <li>Ask the other person to listen without judging.<br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>Remember: </strong>You did the best you could in the situation based on the information you had at the time.</p>
        <p><strong>3.2 How to Talk About Deployment</strong></p>
        <p>Not talking about deployment can increase upsetting thoughts and feelings.  It can limit your ability to understand what happened or deal with your feelings.  On the other hand, talking about your deployment all the time can be too much for you and others to handle.  Finding a balance between these extremes is the goal.</p>
        <ul ><li>How do you open up to others and strengthen your social ties?  Things you may want to talk about include:</li>
        <li>The actual events of your deployment</li>
        <li>Thoughts and feelings you have about those events</li>
        <li>Ways you’ve coped with your experiences</li>
        <li>Ways you’ve grown or changed since your deployment</li>
        <li>Practical decisions, such as what to do about your job</li>
        <li>Thoughts about your future</li>
        <li>Ways you found strength you didn't know you had</li>
        <li>Things you’ve learned that might help others to cope with similar experiences<br /> </li>
        </ul><p>You should also figure out the best times to talk about what happened.  It’s a good idea to wait to talk about your deployment until:</p>
        <ul ><li>You’re well rested</li>
        <li>You’re with someone you know and trust</li>
        <li>You’ve got enough time to share your thoughts and get feedback</li>
        <li>You’re not already feeling upset</li>
        <li>You’ve got some privacy<br /> </li>
        </ul><p>Other service members worry about getting emotional when talking about deployment.  If that worries you, remember these tips:</p>
        <ul ><li>It’s ok to get emotional.  Once you share, your emotions won’t seem as overwhelming</li>
        <li>Tell the person you may get emotional, and you’d appreciate their support if you do.</li>
        <li>Take a chance.  Talk about painful feelings or thoughts even if it’s hard.</li>
        <li>Expect some uncomfortable feelings after talking about hard issues.  Know that these feeling are easier to handle with time and practice.</li>
        <li>Inform the other person you may need to take a break to calm down or collect yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you finish talking:</p>
        <ul ><li>Thank the person for listening.  They should know you value their time and support.</li>
        <li>Schedule a cool-down time after talking.  Do something fun and easy to help shift back to the present.</li>
        <li>Plan to talk about your deployment with someone you trust.  Schedule your plan once a week or once a month.</li>
        <li>Expect the other person to respond in ways that bother or upset you.  If that happens, know that they probably don’t have bad intentions.  Talk with them about what bothered you, or ask someone else for their opinion.<br type="_moz" /><br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>We strongly encourage you to get help and support from a trained behavioral health professional if you:</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Feel extremely sad or depressed for more than a week.</li>
        <li>Have anxious or distressing thoughts you can’t control for more than a week.</li>
        <li>Find it difficult to work or meet your daily responsibilities.</li>
        <li>Experience relationship problems, or have trouble taking care of your family.</li>
        <li>Increase your use of alcohol or drugs to cope.</li>
        <li>Overuse of prescription medications.</li>
        <li>Have traumatic stress reactions that do NOT get better as time passes.</li>
        <li>Think about hurting or killing yourself.</li>
        <li>Think about hurting or killing someone else.</li>
        <li>Feel extremely angry most of the time.</li>
        <li>Have trouble sleeping most of the time.</li>
        <li>Have problems eating or lose significant weight without trying.</li>
        <li>Know others are concerned about you and think you should talk to someone.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>3.3 Talking to a Professional</strong></p>
        <p>Many service members find help in talking to a professional, such as a psychologist, counselor, spiritual advisor, doctor, or nurse.  Others join a support group of people with similar experiences.  The decision to seek professional counseling is a choice.  Remember, some situations require more professional help than others.<br /> </p>
        <p><strong>If you are feeling suicidal or homicidal, let someone know. Seek help immediately.  Call 911 or the Suicide Crisis hotline at 1-800-273-TALK.</strong><br /> </p>
        <p>It doesn’t have to be an emergency to get help from a professional therapist or counselor.  Experts who work with military personnel can help you:</p>
        <ul ><li>Manage your feelings and thoughts more effectively</li>
        <li>Feel more comfortable talking to people in your daily life</li>
        <li>Pursue goals that are important to you</li>
        <li>Focus on your future</li>
        <li>Use the Trigger Record <em>as soon as possible</em> each time you are triggered<br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>Using your Trigger Record:</strong></p>
        <p>It is important that you recognize what triggered you.  It is also important to see how the trigger affected your emotions, physical reactions, and behaviors.  You will begin to see how trauma triggers are different from the original traumatic experience.  If you have strong feelings or sensations, you can start from there and work backwards to determine the trigger that set you off.</p>

      title : '4.0 - Managing Relationship Problems',
      content : `
        <p>You may face insensitive questions from people or feel that people do not want to listen to your experiences.  There are many helpful responses you can use to manage relationships with your family, friends, and community.<br type="_moz" /><br /> </p>
        <p><strong>4.1 Frustrating Questions</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>When you come back home someone may ask you, “Did you kill anyone?”, “What did you do over there?“ or “Are you screwed up now?”</li>
        <li>Because some questions may upset you, you should think of your response ahead of time.  Planning ahead will keep you from doing or saying anything you may regret.</li>
        <li>Let’s look at some responses to awkward questions:</li>
        <li>“No offense, but I don’t like to talk about my deployment</li>
        <li>“I’m not comfortable answering those questions right now, but I appreciate your interest.”</li>
        <li>“Oh, let’s not go there.  Let’s talk about something else.”</li>
        <li>“Let’s talk about this another time.”</li>
        <li>“I have a lot of strong opinions on that subject.  Do you have time to listen?”</li>
        <li>“That’s not a cool thing to say (or ask)”</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>4.2 Unhelpful Responses</strong></p>
        <p>Sometimes you may get a sense from people that you shouldn’t talk about your deployment.  You may think they want you to just forget about your experiences or keep your feelings to yourself.  You might think they don’t care about your thoughts or feelings. Remember, it is possible that they are struggling with their own thoughts and feelings about what you’re saying. </p>
        <p><br />Unhelpful responses from your listener:</p>
        <ul ><li>Seems too bus to talk</li>
        <li>Acts uncomforable wen you talk to them about your experiences</li>
        <li>Doesn't understand what you mean</li>
        <li>Complains about their own problems instead of listening to you</li>
        <li>Tries to fix the problem instead of listening</li>
        <li>Responds by saying "Forget it, it's in the past." or "Just ge over it."</li>
        <li>Reacts with shock or judes your behavior</li>
        <li>Criicizes your feelings or the ways tha you havbe coping</li>
        <li>Criticizes you for what you di while deployed<br /> </li>
        </ul><p>Some Ways to Respond to Unhelpful Responses:</p>
        <ul ><li>When others don’t respond in a helpful way, take steps to let them know what you need.</li>
        <li>Remember they care but may have trouble showing it.</li>
        <li>Tell them what they can do to help.</li>
        <li>Let them know how you feel when they don’t listen.</li>
        <li>Tell them specifically what they’re doing that makes it hard to talk to them.</li>
        <li>Remember that most people don’t know much about war and the military.</li>
        <li>Walk away.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>4.3 Dealing with Problem Behaviors From Others</strong></p>
        <p>Unfortunately, some people in your social network back home may be negative, critical, or more unhelpful than supportive.  These people exhibit “problem behavior” such as:</p>
        <ul ><li>Blaming you or telling you it’s your fault</li>
        <li>Criticizing you for what happened</li>
        <li>Making fun of your reactions</li>
        <li>Refusing to listen to feedback about how their behavior affects you</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Warning signs you may be with someone with problem behaviors that could be a problem for you:</p>
        <ul ><li>You feel irritable after spending time with this person</li>
        <li>You feel pressured by this person to use illegal substances or drink excessively</li>
        <li>You notice the person keeps changing the subject or ignoring what’s important</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Learn how to handle people who antagonize you by:</p>
        <ul ><li>Reducing the time you spend socializing with them</li>
        <li>Bring a supportive person with you when you spend time around them</li>
        <li>Avoid discussions that involve upsetting or other private issues</li>
        <li>Remember that taking care of yourself is your top priority</li>
        <li>Set limits: ask them to stop if they are being rude, prying, or critical</li>
        </ul>
