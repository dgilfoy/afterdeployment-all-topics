        <p>A “stressor” is anything you perceive as a personal threat or beyond your ability to manage.&nbsp; Stressors can be minor hassles or serious life challenges.&nbsp; 
        Stressors can also be thoughts and memories of painful past events.&nbsp; Even though you’re unaware of it, you constantly monitor what’s going on around and inside you.&nbsp; 
        You judge whether situations are a threat to your well-being.&nbsp; You also judge whether you can manage or cope with things.</p>
        <p><strong>2.2 Types of Stressors&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>It’s important to understand the things that cause you to feel stressed.&nbsp; Once you know the sources of your stress, you will be able to anticipate and manage your stress more effectively. Here are some different types of stressors.</p>

        <p><br><strong>2.3 Trigger Stressors</strong></p>
        <p>Certain events that happen during daily living can trigger stress responses. For instance, after returning from deployment, it’s normal for sounds (a car backfiring), sights (upset children), or smells (diesel fuel) that you associated with stressful deployment triggers. Triggers may also remind you of stressful events from your life before the military. If you often over-react to things, or if ordinary events set you off, your stress level may be too high.</p>

          <p>There are many healthy ways to manage your stress.&nbsp; In this chapter we will explore different skills and techniques.<br><br><strong>3.1 Quick Stress Reduction Exercises</strong></p>
          <p>When stressed, your breathing becomes fast and shallow and your muscles tense.&nbsp; You can interrupt the stress response with slow, deep breathing and relaxing your muscles.<br><br><strong>3.2 Deep Breathing Technique</strong></p>
          <p>Like any other skill you learn, deep breathing <strong><em>must be practiced</em></strong>.&nbsp; It is easy to learn and reduces tension, anxiety, and irritability.&nbsp; When you breathe slowly and deeply, your heart rate slows and your blood pressure is lowered.&nbsp; The following exercise takes 2 minutes:</p>
          <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li>Slowly inhale air deeply into your belly until fully extended.&nbsp; Keep your chest still.</li>
            <li>Now exhale slowly, allowing the air you breathe out to deflate your belly.</li>
            <li>Pause naturally, and&nbsp;then repeat.</li>
            <li>Inhale and exhale counting to the number eight, then inhale and exhale counting backward from eight.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Focus on breathing, counting, and relaxing.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><br>You <strong><em>will</em></strong> get results if you keep practicing!&nbsp;<br><br><strong>3.3 Progressive Muscle Relaxation Technique</strong><br><br>If you’re not in a position to fight or flee, you will continue to feel physically stressed.&nbsp; But if you can relax your muscles, your physical stress will subside.&nbsp; Learning to relax your muscles reduces tension and calms you.&nbsp; Here’s how to relax your muscles:</p>
          <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li>Sit or lie in a comfortable position with your feet, hands, arms, and neck supported.</li>
            <li>Take a few deep breaths and think the word “relax”.</li>
            <li>Focus on your legs and feet.&nbsp; Tense your legs by flexing your feet and pointing your toes toward your upper body.&nbsp; You’ll feel tension spread through your feet and legs.</li>
            <li>Hold for a few seconds and then release.&nbsp; Relax your feet and legs completely, while thinking the word “relax”.</li>
            <li>Now focus on your belly.&nbsp; Tense your belly by pulling it in toward your spine.</li>
            <li>Hold for a few seconds then release.&nbsp; Tense your hands and arms by making a tight fist and tensing your forearms, biceps, and triceps.</li>
            <li>Hold for a few seconds and then release.&nbsp; Relax your hands and arms completely, while thinking the word “relax”.</li>
            <li>Continue by tensing the following muscle groups:</li>
            <li>Your shoulders</li>
            <li>Your jaw</li>
            <li>The muscles around your eyes</li>
            <li>Your forehead</li>
            <li>Hold the tension in each muscle group for a few seconds and then release the tension and think the word “relax”.</li>
            <li>Once you complete this exercise, you should feel more relaxed and your stress level should decrease.</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>In this chapter you will learn several strategies you can use to help change the way you think about real life situations you find yourself that may cause you stress. Changing the way you think can change the way you feel.<br><br><strong>Mental Reframing</strong></p>
        <p>The way people think about things affects their reactions to stress.&nbsp; After a deployment, you may believe the world is a more dangerous place or constantly worry that harm could come to you or your loved ones.&nbsp; Or you may feel you have less control over your life.&nbsp; These thoughts may cause you to look at situations and events differently than before you were deployed.&nbsp; It’s normal to think differently about your environment after a deployment.</p>
        <p>Everyone has a constant stream of thoughts running through their minds—this is called <strong>self-talk</strong>.&nbsp; Self-talk reflects your beliefs and attitudes about the world, other people, and yourself.&nbsp; It’s important to examine your thoughts and beliefs carefully challenge those thoughts that are not realistic of helpful.</p>
        <p>Mental reframing is a process you can learn to interrupt self-talk and challenge negative thoughts with more realistic, positive thoughts.&nbsp; There are 5 steps involved in mental reframing:</p>
        <p><strong>Step 1: Self-monitoring</strong></p>
        <p>Your first step in mental reframing is to monitor your thoughts (self-talk).&nbsp; Your awareness of self-talk in stressful situations will help you to prepare to <strong><em>think</em></strong> differently.</p>
        <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td height="58">
        <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td>
        <div>
        <p>&nbsp;(<strong>A</strong>)ctivating event <strong>+</strong> (<strong>B</strong>)eliefs&nbsp; <strong>= </strong>(<strong>C</strong>)onsequences)</p>
        </div>
        </td>
        </tr></tbody></table></td>
        </tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Step 2: The ABC Method</strong></p>
        <p>The second step in mental reframing is to identify those thoughts that cause feelings and motivate your behavior.&nbsp; In most situations, people do not automatically respond to events.&nbsp; People usually think about an event, about their ability to manage the situation, and <em>then</em> they respond.&nbsp; Often your thoughts or interpretation of a stressful event leads to a stress reaction.&nbsp; The “ABC” method is a good way to think of the relationship between thoughts and behaviors:</p>
        <ol style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>An <u><strong>A</strong></u>ctivating event is a stressful situation or event</li>
        <li>The event triggers thought or <u><strong>B</strong></u>eliefs</li>
        <li>As a <u><strong>C</strong></u>onsequence your beliefs about the event change your stress level</li>
        </ol><p><br>Here is an example of the ABC model:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><u>A</u><u>ctivating event</u>: While on leave, you hop on a bus to visit family. The bus gets stuck in traffic because of road construction.</li>
        <li><u>Beliefs</u>: As you take in the situation, you begin to form beliefs about the event. Your beliefs determine whether you see this as a minor inconvenience or a major problem.</li>
        <li><u>Consequences</u>: The consequence of your beliefs is that you feel stressed OR relaxed for the rest of the ride, depending on what your beliefs tell you.</li>
        </ul><p><br><u>Negative Beliefs about the event</u></p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>This will take forever.&nbsp; I’ll never get home.</li>
        <li>Why does this always happen to me?</li>
        <li>They always do construction at the worst times.</li>
        </ul><p><u>Positive Beliefs about the event</u></p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>I’ll just be a few minutes late.</li>
        <li>I’m going to listen to some music while I wait.</li>
        <li>I’m glad they are fixing the road</li>
        </ul><p><br><u>Step 3: Negative Thought Patterns</u></p>
        <p>The third step in mental reframing is to recognize when your beliefs about an event or situation are unhelpful or negative.&nbsp; The following are examples of negative thought patterns that can increase stress levels:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><u>All or Nothing</u>: You tend to experience things in black and white terms.&nbsp; You see situations as either entirely “<em>good</em>” or “<em>bad</em>”, when there is clearly a middle ground.&nbsp; An example of all-or-nothing thinking is that <strong><em>either</em></strong> you are perfect <strong><em>or </em></strong>you’re a failure.</li>
        <li><u>Exaggeration</u>: Sometimes exaggeration is also called “catastrophizing”.&nbsp; This thinking pattern involves blowing the imagined consequences of an event out of proportion.&nbsp; You may see minor problems as being “horrible” or “disastrous”.&nbsp; Others may say “you’re making a mountain out of a molehill”.&nbsp; Sometimes it is hard to pinpoint your trigger.&nbsp; If you can’t identify it, don’t worry.&nbsp; Work on relaxing and calming yourself.</li>
        <li><u>Overgeneralization</u>: &nbsp;You take an isolated experience or piece of information and draw the wrong conclusions.&nbsp; You see isolated negative events as a never-ending pattern of negative events or defeat.&nbsp; For example, if someone turns you down for a date, you conclude that you are <em>always</em> rejected or that you will <em>never</em> find the right person.&nbsp; Look for words such as <strong>always</strong> or <strong>never </strong>in your self-talk as signs that you are over generalizing.</li>
        <li><u>Mind-reading</u>: You assume you know what another person is thinking, even though you have no evidence to back up your assumptions.&nbsp; When you mind-read, you almost always assume that someone is thinking the worst about you.&nbsp; For example, you might think your friends don’t want to hear about your deployment experiences.&nbsp; In reality, your friends want to know what happened but feel awkward asking you questions.&nbsp; Look for phrases like <strong>he/ she probably thinks</strong>...or <strong>they don’t understand</strong>… in your self-talk as signs that you are mind-reading.</li>
        </ul><p><br><u>Step 4: Challenging Your Thoughts</u></p>
        <p>The fourth step in mental reframing is to challenge your negative thinking patterns and self-talk.&nbsp; This takes a lot of practice and patience because self-talk is a reflection of your core beliefs about yourself, others, and the world.</p>
        <p>Look carefully for evidence that challenges negative or stressful self-talk.&nbsp; In order to challenge your negative thinking, you can ask yourself the following questions:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Is there evidence for or against my stressful thought or belief?</li>
        <li>Am I thinking in all-or-nothing terms?</li>
        <li>Am I using words or phrases such as disastrous, horrible, and awful?</li>
        <li>Am I making sweeping generalizations based on a single event?</li>
        <li>Am I using words like always and never in my self-talk?</li>
        <li>Am I judging what other people think, when I really don’t know what they think?</li>
        <li>Is my information source reliable?</li>
        <li>Are my beliefs based on feelings rather than facts?</li>
        </ul><p><br><u>Step 5: Using Positive Self-talk</u></p>
        <p>The final step in mental reframing is to replace negative, stressful self-talk with positive, empowering self-talk.&nbsp; You may be surprised at how changing your outlook on stressful situations or events can change your life.&nbsp; Every situation presents opportunities to learn and grow.&nbsp; The more you focus on the positive aspects of the situation, the more control you have over your stress reactions.<br><br><strong>3.5 Stress Journal</strong></p>
        <p>Keeping a stress journal helps you realize when you’re having a stress response.&nbsp; The earlier you identify your stress reactions, the sooner you can do something about them.&nbsp; Every time you feel stressed, stop and look closely at your situation.&nbsp; Then enter the following information into your stress journal.&nbsp;</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Where was I?</li>
        <li>What was going on around me?</li>
        <li>Who was I with?</li>
        <li>How could I have used more positive thinking and realistic self-talk to handle stress?</li>
        <li>Could I identify a negative thinking pattern? All-or-nothing thinking</li>
        <li>Exaggeration (catastrophizing)</li>
        <li>Overgeneralization</li>
        <li>Mind-reading</li>
        <li>What was I doing?</li>
        <li>What was I thinking?</li>
        <li>What was I saying to myself (self-talk)?</li>
        <li>What signs of stress was I having (physical, psychological, emotional)?</li>
        <li>On a scale of 0-10, how stressful was this situation?&nbsp; (Zero being as calm and relaxed as possible.&nbsp; Ten being severe stress and panic.</li>
        </ul><p><br><strong>3.6 Emotion-focused Strategies for Coping with Stress</strong></p>
        <p>Often we simply try to cope with stress without realizing we can change the situations and conditions that cause the stress.&nbsp; We <strong>DO</strong> have some control over the causes of stress in our lives.</p>
        <p><em><u>Some stressors can be eliminated or diminished easily. </u></em></p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: Milo has had a nagging toothache for a few weeks that is contributing to his stress and irritability.&nbsp; But he can choose to go to a dentist and take care of the problem.</p>
        <p><em><u>Some stressors can be controlled but the effort we have to expend is much greater.</u></em></p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: Maria needs to pass a course to get into mechanics training.&nbsp; She finds mechanics training difficult and is stressed that she won’t pass the course.&nbsp; But she can control her stress by studying more in her free time.</p>
        <p><em><u>Some stressful situations are simply out of our control.</u></em></p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: Lisa just found out she may have a serious illness.&nbsp; She must wait several days for lab results.&nbsp; Lisa has no control over the results or how long she must wait.&nbsp; To the right you will find strategies to help you overcome negative feelings cause by stress.</p>
        <p align="left"><br><u>Emotion-focused Strategies</u></p>
        <p>When faced with challenges outside your control try one of these strategies:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Listen to music</li>
        <li>Get together with a friend</li>
        <li>Read a book or watch a movie</li>
        <li>Get some physical exercise</li>
        <li>Engage in spiritual activities like prayer</li>
        <li>Try yoga</li>
        <li>Meditate</li>
        <li>Intake some humor</li>
        <li>Take a nap</li>
        <li>Write in a journal or diary</li>
        <li>Take a hot bath</li>
        <li>Help others in need</li>
        <li>Practice “anxiety surfing” (riding out anxieties until they naturally subside)</li>
        <li>Express you stress creatively (painting, playing a musical instrument)</li>
        <li>Take a “mental holiday” (go to the next page for more information about how to take a mental holiday anytime and at any place)</li>
        </ul><p><br><u>Tips For Taking A Mental Holiday</u></p>
        <p>You can use this technique almost any time in any place.&nbsp; Close your eyes and take 3 deep breaths.&nbsp; Imagine you are in a place where you have found peace in the past.&nbsp; Try involving all your senses.&nbsp; You may hear birds singing; feel the warmth of the sun on your shoulders, or smell sea salt.&nbsp; Engage all your senses and enjoy the sensations for a moment or two before returning to the here-and-now.</p>

        <li><strong>STEP 9: </strong>&nbsp;If the First Solution Didn’t Work, Try Another!</li>
        </ul><p>Let’s take a closer look at each step and how you can practice problem-solving strategies for coping with stress.</p>
        <p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Recognize the Signals of Stress</p>
        <p>Learn to watch for signs and situations that often cause stress.</p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: &nbsp;<em>Max has recently returned from Iraq.&nbsp; He couldn’t wait to go home to his wife and son,&nbsp;but now that he is home, he feels anxious and irritable every night as he drives home from base.</em></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 2: </strong>Define the Problem</p>
        <p>Find the real problem and be specific about how it triggers your stress reaction.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max asks himself: “What is it about going home that makes me feel stressed?”&nbsp; He realizes his stress is related to his son’s poor performance at school and bad attitude at home.</em></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 3: </strong>Set a Goal</p>
        <p>Try to set a goal for how to respond in a way that reduces stress.</p>
        <p><em>Max knows he can’t control how other people act and that he can’t turn Max Jr. into a “perfect” son. But, as a father, Max does have some influence over his son.&nbsp; He decides to set specific, manageable goals, such as getting Max Jr. to spend more time on homework and help more around the house. Wait to go home to his wife and son, but now that he is home, he feels anxious and irritable every night as he drives home from base.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;<strong>STEP 4: </strong>Brainstorm Possible Solutions</p>
        <p>Get creative about possible solutions. When you brainstorm, don’t judge any of the solutions, just let them flow. Even if some ideas seem ridiculous, write them down. &nbsp;</p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max starts brainstorming the following solutions without judging them. </em><em>For instance,</em> g<em>round Max Jr. until he changes his attitude and does his homework; send Max Jr. to live with his grandmother; spend more quality time with Max Jr. and talk to him about problem solving; get a tutor for Max Jr.</em></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 5: &nbsp;</strong>Evaluate Possible Solutions</p>
        <p>Review the list of possible solutions and evaluate how well they may address the problem.</p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max makes a list of the pros and cons of each possible solution.</em></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 6: &nbsp;</strong>Choose the Best Solution Based on Pros and Cons</p>
        <p>Problem-solving experts suggest giving special considerations to the solution with the least cons. You may want to pick a second solution in case the first one does not work.</p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: &nbsp;<em>Max studies his list of pros and cons for each possible solution.&nbsp; He finds that the solution with the most pros and fewest cons is to spend more quality time with his son.&nbsp; His back-up solution is to hire a tutor to help Max Jr. with his homework.</em></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 7: &nbsp;</strong>Make a Plan and Try Your Solution</p>
        <p>Now create a specific plan to carry out your solution. You may need to divide the plan into steps.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max has decided on a possible solution and forms a plan.&nbsp; He will sit down with Max Jr. this weekend to make a list of the boy’s favorite things to do.&nbsp; Then they will create a plan for Max Jr. to earn some privileges by spending more time on homework and helping around the house.&nbsp; Max will also make himself available in the evenings to help his son with homework.</em></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 8: </strong>&nbsp;Assess the Solution’s Progress</p>
        <p>Reevaluate the situation and see how the actions have changed things.</p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>A month later, Max evaluates his solution by contacting Max Jr’s teachers and learns his son is improving in his schoolwork.&nbsp; He also sees that Max Jr. volunteers for more chores around the house.&nbsp; Max decides that he has met the goal he set for solving his problem.</em></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 9: </strong>&nbsp;If the First Solution Didn’t Work, Try Another!</p>
        <p>If your solution worked, your stress should diminish.&nbsp; If it didn’t work, try another solution from Step 5 until you find one that works.</p>
        <p><u>Example</u>: <em>Max feels much less irritable and stressed now.&nbsp; In fact, he looks forward to coming home from work.&nbsp; He also knows if his first solution didn’t work, he could have tried his second solution of hiring a tutor</em></p>

      content : `
        <p>In this chapter, you will learn about drug and alcohol use and abuse.</p>
        <p><strong>1.1 Reasons for Using Drugs and Alcohol</strong></p>
        <ul><li>People often drink or use drugs to relax, celebrate, or socialize with others.&nbsp; But people may also use alcohol or drugs to:</li>
        <li>Help fall or stay asleep</li>
        <li>Manage stress and tension</li>
        <li>Numb emotional pain</li>
        <li>Ease physical pain</li>
        <li>"Drown out" worries</li>
        <li>Forget problems</li>
        <li>Decrease sadness</li>
        <li>Relax around others</li>
        <li>Avoid upsetting thoughts and memories</li>
        <li>“Take the edge of”</li>
        <li>Cope with depression</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>1.2 Drinking</strong></p>
        <p>Most service members keep their drinking under control.&nbsp; But excessive drinking can lead to relationship problems, work troubles, and financial or legal difficulties.</p>
        <p>Problem drinking can take different forms, including heavy drinking and binge drinking.&nbsp; People with a heavy drinking problem continue to drink even after serious consequences, like getting a DUI, getting fired, or destroying a marriage.&nbsp; Binge drinkers have five or more drinks at a time. Binge drinkers are 21 times more likely to damage property, get injured in accidents, act violently, have risky sex, drive drunk, or break the law.</p>
        <p><strong>1.3 Drug Use</strong></p>
        <p>Illegal drug use and prescription drug misuse are on the rise among service members.&nbsp; Nearly seven percent of service members report that they abuse illegal or prescription drugs.&nbsp; According to military substance use counselors, the most commonly abused drugs are marijuana, “uppers”</p>
        <p>(Methamphetamines and cocaine), and prescription painkillers (Vicodin and OxyContin).</p>
        <p>Misusing drugs can have severe consequences, like jail time or a dishonorable discharge.&nbsp; Even if they don’t get caught, few people use drugs in moderation.&nbsp; For most people, their drug use gets out of control and causes problems in many areas of life.</p>
        <p><u>Prescription Drug Use:</u></p>
        <p>In some cases, physicians prescribe pain medicine to service members for real problems, like a drug to control pain from an injury.&nbsp; These cases are harder to define as "misusing" or "abusing" drugs, because the medication was prescribed for a valid medical reason.&nbsp; But taking more medication than prescribed can become a serious problem.&nbsp; Some people use prescription medications to numb themselves or escape from stress and painful feelings.&nbsp; These drugs can also lead to depression, trouble thinking clearly, and addiction.&nbsp; Painkillers mixed with other drugs or alcohol can also lead to overdose or death.</p>
        <p>You may be abusing prescription drugs if you:</p>
        <ul><li>Take more medication than your physician prescribed</li>
        <li>Run out of the medication early</li>
        <li>Use the medication longer than prescribed</li>
        <li>Take the medication to get high or feel better emotionally</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>1.4 Substance Use Disorders</strong></p>
        <p>Substance use disorders can range in severity from mild to severe. The level of severity generally depends on how many symptoms occur. Presence of two to three symptoms indicates a mild disorder, four to five indicate a moderate disorder, and six or more symptoms indicate a severe disorder.</p>
        <ul><li>Headache</li>
        <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
        <li>Stomach pain</li>
        <li>Shakes or jitters</li>
        <li>Chills, sweats, or fevers</li>
        <li>Anxiety or panic attacks</li>
        <li>Hard time falling asleep</li>
        <li>Craving or strong desire to use the substance</li>
        <li>Difficulty controlling the amount of the substance used</li>
        <li>Difficulty stopping or decreasing use</li>
        <li>Spending a lot of time getting and using the substance, or getting over its effects</li>
        <li>Giving up important activities or responsibilities due to substance use</li>
        <li>Continuing to use substance, despite knowing the harm it can cause</li>
        <li>Having problems with family, friends, at school, or at work</li>
        <li>Being high or drunk in dangerous situations (such as while driving)Arguing or fighting with others while using</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Substance abuse is a pattern of use that includes one or more of the following in a twelve-month period:</p>
        <ul><li>Having problems with family, friends, at school, or at work</li>
        <li>Being high or drunk in dangerous situations (such as while driving)</li>
        <li>Getting into trouble with the law because of substance use</li>
        <li>Arguing or fighting with others while using</li>

        <p>Alcohol and drugs may seem to make things better.&nbsp; Substances may help you sleep, forget your problems, or feel more relaxed.&nbsp; But alcohol and drugs have substantial risks for your personal health, well-being and relationships.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>2.1 How Do You Know When There Is a Problem?</strong></p>
        <p>If you are concerned about a possible substance use problem, look for difficulties in these areas:</p>
        <ul><li>Work/School</li>
          <li>Mental Well-being</li>
          <li>Relationships</li>
          <li>Spirituality</li>
          <li>Family</li>
          <li>Self-respect</li>
          <li>Money</li>
          <li>Legal Record</li>
          <li>Physical Health</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you think you may have a drug or alcohol problem, ask yourself:</p>
        <ul><li>Have my family or friends commented on how much or how often I drink or use alcohol?</li>
          <li>Have I been feeling guilty about my drinking or drug use?</li>
          <li>Have I been drinking more or using more drugs over time?</li>
          <li>Have I tried unsuccessfully to cut down on alcohol or drugs?</li>
          <li>Do I use alone when I’m angry, sad, bored or lonely?</li>
          <li>So I use when I’m reminded of upsetting deployment memories?</li>
          <li>Does my using ever make me late for work?</li>
          <li>Does my family worry about my drinking or drug use?</li>
          <li>Do I ever use after telling myself I won’t?</li>
          <li>Have I ever forgotten what I did while drinking or using?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you answered "yes" to one or more of these questions, it may be time to look at how much you're using.&nbsp; Try cutting back with help from friends, family, community groups (like Alcoholics Anonymous/ Narcotics Anonymous) or a health care professional.</p>
        <p><strong>2.2 Common Excuses To Drink Or Use Drugs</strong></p>
        <p>Do any of these statements sound familiar; have you used any of them to explain your behavior to a friend or family member?</p>
        <ul><li>“At least I don’t use hard drugs”</li>
          <li>“I can control myself if I want to; I just don’t want to!”</li>
          <li>“I only drink beer (wine), and everyone else does it.”</li>
          <li>“I’ve never missed a day of work (or school).”</li>
          <li>“I’m not an alcoholic– alcoholics drink all day, every day.”</li>
          <li>“I don’t need help, I can handle it myself.”</li>
          <li>“I gave it up for 3 weeks last year so I’m fine.”</li>
          <li>“Sure, I drink a lot, but I can stop whenever I want.”</li>
          <li>“I don't’ drink every day.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>2.3 Substance Use and Relationships</strong></p>
        <p>It's hard to have healthy relationships if you regularly get drunk or high.&nbsp; Here’s a list of relationship problems caused by substance abuse:</p>
        <ul><li>Fighting and arguments</li>
          <li>Loved ones feel rejected by someone who’s always drunk or high</li>
          <li>Secrets and lies that damage trust and intimacy</li>
          <li>Poor choices that affect loved ones and cause them worry</li>
          <li>Communication problems</li>
          <li>Children confused and hurt by aggressive behavior, emotional distance, or inconsistency</li>
          <li>Families affected by accidents and arrests</li>
          <li>Family violence and accidents</li>
          <li>Higher risk of driving under the influence with family members in the car</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>2.4 How To Tell If You’re Having Problems With Alcohol</strong></p>
        <p>Some people find drinking more relieves stress - have you noticed this in yourself?&nbsp; If so, try to get a sense of whether your pattern of drinking is dangerous or causing problems.&nbsp; Answer these questions honestly–they’re meant to help you assess your drinking.&nbsp; Then score your answers.&nbsp; You may want to print or write these questions out.</p>
        <p><strong>Quantity-Frequency Measure:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>On average, how many days during the week do you drink?</li>
          <li>On a typical day when you drink, how many drinks do you have?</li>
          <li>Multiply the first number by the second number</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How&nbsp;To Measure Your Score:</strong> Sgt. Jones says he drinks a six-pack of beer on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights.&nbsp; This is 3 days a week, with 6 drinks on each day.&nbsp; To calculate the score, we multiply 3 x 6 to get a score of 18.</p>
        <p><u>Your substance use could be a problem if </u></p>
        <ul>
          <li>You are a Man and your score is 14 or more</li>
          <li>You are a woman and your score is 7 or more</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The number for women is lower because their bodies have a lower percentage of water<br>than men's bodies, less of the enzyme that breaks down alcohol, and a different hormonal<br>make-up.&nbsp; As a result, alcohol remains concentrated in a woman's body longer than in a<br>man’s body.</p>
        <p>If your score indicates your drinking may be a problem, ask yourself these <strong>CAGE</strong> questions:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Over the past year…</p>
        <p><strong>C </strong>- Have you felt you should CUT down on your drinking or drug use?</p>
        <p><strong>A </strong>- Have people ANNOYED you by criticizing your drinking or drug use?</p>
        <p><strong>G</strong> - Have you ever felt GUILTY about your drinking or drug use?</p>
        <p><strong>E</strong> - Have you ever had an “eye-opener” – you drank or used drugs first thing in the morning to “steady your nerves?”</p>
        <p>If you answered yes to 1 or 2 of the CAGE questions might be experiencing alcohol abuse.&nbsp; If you answered yes to 3 or 4 of the CAGE questions, you might be experiencing alcohol dependence.</p>
        <p>If your score on the quantity-frequency measure was more than 14 for men, or 7 for women, and you answered yes to three or four of the CAGE questions, it’s likely you are experiencing substance dependence.&nbsp; Substance dependence is serious.&nbsp; It can affect your mood, functioning at work, relationships, health and more.&nbsp; Substance dependence requires professional help (see Services to Help You Quit section of this chapter).</p>
        <p>If your score on the quantity-frequency measure was more than 14 for men, or 7 for women, and you answered yes to one or two of the CAGE questions, it’s likely you are experiencing substance abuse.&nbsp; Substance abuse can affect your work, your relationships, your emotions, and your health.&nbsp; It can also lead to substance dependence, so you should talk about your drinking with a healthcare professional while you still have control.&nbsp; See the Services to Help You Quit section of this chapter.</p>

      title : '3.0 Substance Use and Post-Traumatic Stress',
      content : `
        <p>There is a strong link between traumatic events and substance use problems.&nbsp; Many trauma survivors use alcohol or drugs to relieve stress, depression, and upsetting memories. Using substances to AVOID can actually make things worse not better. Struggling to cope with a traumatic event doesn’t always lead to problems with alcohol or drugs.&nbsp; However, service members who experienced combat and other traumatic events are more likely to have problems with alcohol and drugs.&nbsp; These substances make it more difficult to deal with stress and trauma.</p>
        <p><strong>3.1 Post-Traumatic Stress Reactions</strong></p>
        <p>Combat stress, or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), is a set of emotional challenges that occur after someone has been through a traumatic or stressful event.</p>
        <p><strong>There are four main types of Post-Traumatic Stress reactions:</strong></p>
        <ol><li><strong>Re-experiencing the trauma: </strong>Flashbacks, nightmares, memories you can't erase, or intense emotional and physical reactions to trauma reminders (being triggered)</li>
        <li><strong>Negative changes in mood and thoughts</strong>: Always thinking that the world, other people or oneself are entirely bad or dangerous, lost interest in things, feeling detached from others, or unable to feel positively about oneself or others.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoidance</strong>: Avoiding activities, people, or places that remind you of the trauma; avoiding talking or thinking about the trauma.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased arousal</strong>: Having a hard time sleeping and concentrating, being irritable, on guard and "jumpy," or having intense responses to being startled (hitting the dirt).</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>3.2 Drinking and Using Drugs To Cope With Combat Stress</strong></p>
        <p>To cope with these challenging reactions, service members often turn to substances to "self-medicate."&nbsp; But alcohol or drugs only provide <em>temporary</em> relief to painful memories and feelings.&nbsp; And those<br>substances produce a lot of downsides:</p>

        </tr></tbody></table>
        <p><strong>3.3&nbsp;Breaking the Connection</strong></p>
        <p>Some service members think, "I'm not willing to cut back right now, I just want to focus on getting rid of my combat stress."&nbsp; Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.&nbsp; Substance use affects combat stress, and combat stress can lead to substance abuse, so don’t ignore the link between the two.</p>
        <p><strong>3.4&nbsp;Sleep Problems and Substance Abuse</strong></p>
        <p>Many Service Members who have combat stress reactions also have the following sleep problems:</p>
        <ul><li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Trouble falling asleep</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Waking up often</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Restless sleep</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Nightmares</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Substances may help you fall asleep or avoid nightmares, but they may also make you more irritable and “on guard.”&nbsp; Drinking or smoking pot often makes it harder to get a restful night's sleep.&nbsp; Alcohol may help you fall asleep, but it prevents you from getting restful sleep.&nbsp; As the alcohol wears off, the body wakes up over and over again during the night.&nbsp; This contributes to feeling hung over, tired and irritable the next day. Using these substances to AVOID your feelings prevents healing and can make it worse, and can contribute to developing PTSD.</p>
        <p><strong>3.5&nbsp;Developing Healthy Coping Skills</strong></p>

        <p>In this section, you will learn how to make healthy choices about alcohol and drugs by learning about moderate drinking, tips for safe drinking, and the effects of your blood alcohol concentration.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4.1&nbsp; What is Moderate Drinking?</strong></p>
        <p>It is important to know how much drinking is too much, or "when to say when."&nbsp; For most adults, consuming a moderate amount of alcohol is not harmful and will not lead to alcohol-related problems. Moderate alcohol use means:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Up to two drinks per day for men</li>
        <li>Up to one drink per day for women</li>
        <li>Up to one drink per day for older adults</li>
        </ul><p><br>One drink means:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>A 12-ounce bottle of beer</li>
        <li>A 5-ounce glass of wine</li>
        <li>1.5 ounces of 80 proof distilled liquor</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Moderate alcohol use is <em><u>not</u></em> safe for everyone.</p>
        <p>Here are some ideas of things you can say when you choose to refuse a drink:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>“I’m driving.”</li>
        <li>“No, thanks.”</li>
        <li>“I have something to do in the morning.”</li>
        <li>“I’m training for a marathon/triathlon/other sporting event.”</li>
        <li>“I drank too much last night so I’m taking it easy tonight.”</li>
        <li>“I’m taking a break from drinking for a couple of weeks.”</li>
        <li>“I have too much work to do in the morning.”</li>
        <li>“I’m allergic to alcohol.”</li>
        <li>“If I have another one, I’ll fall asleep."&nbsp;</li>
        <li>"I’ll get a coffee or a soda instead.”</li>
        <li>“I have an important meeting tomorrow.”</li>
        <li>“I’m OK for now.” (Keep a half-filled cup even if you’re not drinking)</li>
        <li>“I’m taking medication that I can’t mix with alcohol.”</li>
        <li>“I’m trying to lose weight.”</li>
        <li>“I had a migraine headache earlier.”</li>
        <li>"I'm pregnant.”</li>
        <li>“Thanks but I’ve already had enough to drink tonight.”</li>
        <li><strong>“</strong>Sorry, I never drink on Mondays.” (Tues, Weds, and so forth)</li>
        <li>“No thanks. My liver is tired.”</li>
        <li>“I’m under the weather today.”</li>
        <li>“I don’t feel like praying to the porcelain god tonight.”</li>
        <li>“I have a bet with someone to see how long I can go without drinking.”</li>
        <li>“I already had a six-pack!”</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>4.2 Putting Moderate Drinking Into Action</strong></p>
        <p>To keep your drinking within moderate levels, you might:<br>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Think of three reasons to drink moderately before you go out.</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>I want to wake up early.</li>
        <li>I want to exercise in the morning.</li>
        <li>My girlfriend/boyfriend doesn't like it when I drink.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Make a plan:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Bring enough money for only a couple of drinks; leave your creit cards home</li>
        <li>Decide ahead of time how many drinks you will have.</li>
        <li>Decide how you’ll get home <em>safely</em>.</li>
        <li>Commit to going home at a certain time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While you’re out, call someone who cares about you.</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Ask them to remind you why you decided to drink moderately.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Drink non-alcoholic drinks, or alternate between alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Drink a lot of water.</li>
        <li>Order some food.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For some people, it is hard to imagine having fun without alcohol. But there are lots of ways to have fun when other people are drinking and you are not:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Play bartender or DJ.</li>
        <li>Watch a movie.</li>
        <li>Start up a game of pool, darts, cards, or a video game.</li>
        <li>Find other non-drunk people.&nbsp; You might make new friends.</li>
        <li>Pretend to be drunk - your drunk friends won't know the difference.</li>
        <li>Play drinking games with non-alcoholic drinks.</li>
        <li>Take funny pictures of your friends.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>4.3 Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)</strong></p>
        <p>Blood Alcohol Concentration, or BAC, is the amount of alcohol in your blood at any given time, which determines the effects that alcohol has on you.</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>A BAC of .10 is enough to be considered <em>legally drunk</em>.</li>
        <li>The legal level for driving drunk in most states is .08.</li>
        <li>Bodies burn or metabolize alcohol at a steady rate.</li>
        <li>You can’t dilute alcohol in your system with nonalcoholic drinks or food.</li>
        <li>The only thing that lowers your BAC is <em>time</em>.</li>
        <li>The faster someone drinks, the higher their BAC rises.</li>
        <li>Other things that affect BAC:</li>
        <li>Gender (Women's BAC increases more quickly)</li>
        <li>Weight</li>
        <li>Metabolism</li>
        <li>Use of medication<br type="_moz"><br>&nbsp;</li>

        <p><strong>4.6&nbsp; Tips For Getting Home Safely</strong></p>
        <p>Here are some tips for getting home safely after a night out:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><strong>Plan ahead.&nbsp; </strong>Have a solid plan in place before you start drinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Designate a driver.</strong>&nbsp; Decide beforehand who the non-drinking driver will be. Choose someone reliable. Pay for their non-alcoholic drinks and their gas.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep taxi numbers and money handy.</strong> Take a couple of cab company phone numbers and cab fare money with you.&nbsp; Put the money in a place where you are sure not to spend it on something else.</li>
        <li><strong>Public transportation/Local transportation.&nbsp; </strong>Before you go out, look up late night public transportation times and stash some money away for the fare. Some cities also have cheap late night transportation options to get people home safely.</li>
        <li><strong>Plan to walk home.&nbsp; </strong>Sometimes walking home can be a great idea. Be sure to walk with someone else, and stay in well-lit areas. Don't let your friends wander off alone, especially when they are drunk.</li>
        <li><strong>Get a hotel room or stay with a friend.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>4.7&nbsp; Caring For A Friend Who Has Had Too Much To Drink</strong></p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><strong>Know the warning signs.</strong>&nbsp; If you see your friends talking loudly, slurring their speech, getting excitable or aggressive, wobbling or weaving, or feeling nauseous, step in and help.</li>
        <li><strong>Make them aware that they are drunk.&nbsp; </strong>Pull them aside, express your concern, and suggest they stop or slow their drinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Help your friend get home.&nbsp; </strong>Don't let your friend stumble off alone, even if they tell you they can manage on their own.&nbsp; Stick together, keep your friend walking, and decide if food will help.&nbsp; Food helps someone who is tipsy, not someone who is drunk and may get sick.</li>
        <li><strong>Walk or get a taxi.&nbsp; </strong>Fresh air and a walk often help people stay alert.&nbsp; Consider if walking back home is safe.&nbsp; If your friend is wobbly on their feet or is loud and obnoxious, call a cab.&nbsp; In the cab, keep the windows rolled down.&nbsp; Ask the driver to stop if you think your friend may throw up.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't leave them on their doorstep!&nbsp; </strong>Once you reach your destination, don't leave your friend alone. If your friend lives with someone, let that person know the situation. If your friend lives alone, consider staying the night. Make sure your friend sleeps on the side or stomach in case of vomiting.</li>
        <li><strong>Really worried? Get help.&nbsp; </strong>Call an ambulance or go directly to the emergency room if you are worried about your friend blacking out, passing out, or having a seizure.</li>
        </ul>

      title : '5.0 Abstinence: When Safe Use Is No Use',
      content : `
      <p>Some people should seriously consider quitting drugs or alcohol altogether when:</p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Alcohol/Drugs control you.&nbsp; Some people find it hard to control their drinking or drug use.&nbsp; The drinking or using drugs controls the person, rather than the other way around.&nbsp; If this sounds like you, the best strategy is to completely avoid alcohol and drugs.</li>
      <li>You have chronic problems in relationships such as:
      <ul><li>Exposing loved ones to violence or harm</li>
      <li>Avoiding or distancing emotionally from family</li>
      <li>Hurting family finances by spending too much money on alcohol or drugs<br>&nbsp;</li>
      </ul></li>
      </ul><p>Some service members are motivated to quit when family members confront them about their drinking/using.&nbsp; Others quit on their own to try and repair damaged relationships.<br><br>If you use illegal drugs, STOP!&nbsp; You are risking your health, military career, your relationships, and your legal record.</p>
      
      <p><strong>5.1 Staying “Clean”</strong></p>
      <p>If you decide to stop drinking or using, you will notice some continued cravings or thoughts about alcohol and drugs.&nbsp; People, places, objects, feelings, and times can cause these thoughts and cravings. These are called <strong><em>triggers.</em></strong>&nbsp; For example, if you're used to going out to drink with friends on Friday nights, your personal triggers could be:</p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Friday night</li>
      <li>After work</li>
      <li>Friends who drink<br>&nbsp;</li>
      </ul><p>Triggers can cause you to use again. Your brain may also give you permission to drink or use, also known as <strong><em>relapse justification</em></strong>. One side of your brain may say its okay to drink or use, while the other side of your brain says to stay sober. Even this mental argument can lead to drug and alcohol use.<br><br>Cravings are not always easy to detect. Thoughts and cravings may pass through your mind unnoticed. It takes work to identify and stop a thought. But the more you think about using drugs or alcohol, the more likely you will start drinking or using again. This is called a "relapse."</p>
      <p>Triggers, thoughts, cravings, and using all seem to get tangled together.&nbsp; To help you understand addiction, the usual sequence goes like this:<br>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">Trigger Thoughts =&gt; Craving =&gt; Drink/Use</span></strong></span></p>
      
      <p><strong>5.2&nbsp;Identifying Triggers</strong></p>
      <p>Triggers that make you want to use alcohol or drugs can be <strong>external</strong>, such as activities, events, or situations.&nbsp; Triggers can also be <strong>internal</strong>, such as negative thoughts or feelings.<br><br>External Triggers</p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>When home alone</li>
      <li>When with friends</li>
      <li>At parties</li>
      <li>At sporting events</li>
      <li>At the movies</li>

      <li>At school</li>
      <li>After going past a liquor store or your dealer's residence</li>
      <li>When with friends who drink or use drugs<br type="_moz"><br>&nbsp;</li>
      </ul><p>Internal Triggers</p>

      <li>Excitement</li>
      <li>Jealousy</li>
      <li>Boredom</li>
      <li>Fatigue<br>&nbsp;</li>
      </ul><p>Other Internal Triggers</p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>Talking about an upsetting employment experience&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Watching the news</li>
      <li>Being reminded of deployment experiences</li>

      <li>Having trouble sleeping because of combat stress</li>
      <li>Feeling irritable after being reminded of deployment expriences</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>5.3&nbsp;How Can I Have Fun If I Don’t Drink or Use?</strong></p>
      <p>Learn to combat boredom and loneliness, because these feelings trigger urges to drink or use.&nbsp; To fight boredom and loneliness:</p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><strong>Go to church, synagogue, mosque or temple:</strong> Joining a place of worship helps you find community, new relationships, and spiritual direction.</li>
      <li><strong>Work out: </strong>Take a class at a local gym or community center.&nbsp; Try a new sport or physical activity, or a martial art.&nbsp; Or join a sports league or hiking group.</li>
      <li><strong>Start or re-start a hobby: </strong>Find a group nearby with similar interests, whether it's music, motorcycles, reading, cooking, or travel.</li>
      <li><strong>Meet for a Meal:</strong> Invite someone to have breakfast, lunch or dinner. &nbsp;Cook for your friends one week, and then ask your friends to cook for you the following week.</li>
      <li><strong>Join a professional group or a neighborhood organization:&nbsp; </strong>You might also join groups based on a professional interest, or volunteer in your local community.</li>
      <li><strong>Take a class:</strong> Expand your horizons by learning an instrument or taking a college or community education course.</li>
      <li><strong>Join a Veterans organization:</strong> Groups such as the American Legion or Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) can give you a place to socialize with others who've served. You can join these groups even while on active duty.</li>
      <li><strong>Volunteer:</strong> Cleaning up a local park, volunteering at a hospital or doing a walkathon can provide a great way to bond with others.</li>
      <li><strong>Be an involved neighbor:</strong> Helping a neighbor with a garden or home maintenance project can be another way to develop relationships.</li>
      <li><strong>Join a cause: </strong>Get together with a group of people working toward a goal you believe in, such as an election or the preservation of a natural area.</li>

      <p><strong>6.2&nbsp; Getting Help For Both Substance Use And Combat Stress/PTSD</strong></p>
      <p>If you have Post-Traumatic Stress, find a professional who works with substance use problems <em>and</em> PTSD. Many VA hospitals offer support and treatment. Contact your local VA hospital or Vet Center for information about programs that work with substance use and combat stress problems. Schedule an appointment with a counselor. They will ask many questions about your substance use (including alcohol, drugs, and prescription medication). The two of you will also discuss the ways that substance use affects your combat stress or PTSD. If you are a service member, each service provides support services that will help you with substance abuse and combat stress/PTSD.</p>

      <p>Working on issues of PTSD and substance abuse at the same time isn’t easy. Your Post-Traumatic Stress reactions may get worse when you first stop drinking or using,. Substance abuse can cause sleep and relationship problems, which make PTSD worse. So working on both issues at the same time is more effective than working on them separately.</p>
      
      <p><strong>6.3 Medications for Substance Use Issues</strong></p>
      <p>Besides therapy, medications can help you stop drinking.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Antabuse</strong> treats alcoholism.&nbsp; Antabuse makes people feel sick when they drink.&nbsp; Over time, they associate feeling sick with drinking. It's called "aversion therapy."</p>
      <p><strong>Naltrexone</strong> is a newer medication to treat alcoholism.&nbsp; It is not aversion therapy, but it can help curb cravings. &nbsp;Naltrexone is not effective for everyone.&nbsp; Talk to your health care provider about it.</p>
      <p>Other medications treat both PTSD and alcoholism.&nbsp; Antidepressants like Paxil and Zoloft may reduce alcohol use in people who also have PTSD.&nbsp; When some people take Naltrexone and an antidepressant, the combination helps reduce drinking more than taking each medication alone.</p>
      
      <p><strong>6.7 Willing to Cut Back, But Not Quit Entirely?</strong></p>
      <ul><li>Write down reasons to limit your drinking or use (family, social, legal, work, etc).</li>
      <li>Set a drinking goal. Choose not to drink at all or stay within safe drinking limits.&nbsp; Write this goal on a piece of paper and put it in a place you will easily see.</li>
      <li>Keep a use journal. Include when, where, what, and how much you use in a week.</li>
      <li>Keep only a limited amount of alcohol (or drugs) at home.</li>
      <li>Take one-hour breaks between drinks.</li>
      <li>Alternate between non-alcoholic drinks and alcoholic drinks.</li>
      <li>Avoid rounds or 'shots.'</li>
      <li>Have one drink at a time and keep track of your drinks-avoid 'topping.'</li>
      <li>Limit mixed drinks. They often hide the taste of alcohol, but not the effects.</li>
      <li>Drink slowly. Take sips, not gulps.</li>
      <li>Eat food when drinking alcohol.</li>
      <li>Pick one or more days of the week to not drink at all, and then pick a full week.</li>
      <li>Practice ways to say “no” when offered a drink (or other substance). Use the phrases on the <strong><em>Ways to Refuse a Drink</em></strong> list in our <strong>Expert Advice</strong> section.</li>
      <li>Avoid people who criticize your decision not to use.</li>
      <li>Be aware of your triggers and avoid them. If you can’t avoid them, plan ahead with strategies to resist temptation.</li>
      <li>Avoid drinking when angry, upset, or after a bad day.</li>
      <li>Stay busy - don't just sit around and drink.</li>
      <li>Be assertive - don't be pressured into drinking.</li>
      <li>Get help from family, friends, a healthcare provider, church member, and/or self-help group like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).</li>
      <li>Don't give up; it may take several attempts to make healthy changes to your substance use habits.</li>

      content : `
        <p>Now that you’re at home, you may feel and act differently than you did before deployments.  Your family and friends may have changed too.  This is common and normal.  You may find it hard to reconnect with loved ones and wonder if things well ever get back to “normal”. </p>
        <p>Are any of these common post-deployment issues a problem for you?</p>
        <ul><li>I’m less interested in activities I used to enjoy</li>
        <li>I’m having a hard time trusting others</li>
        <li>I need to be in control of my emotions all the time</li>
        <li>I don’t want to talk about what happened in the war zone</li>
        <li>I’m having a hard time with face-to-face communications</li>
        <li>I have less interest in sexual activity</li>
        <li>I’m confused about my role at home</li>
        <li>I’m having a hard time talking with my kids</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>1.2 Improving Family Relationships</strong></p>
        <p>After a long separation, it’s common to have tensions and disagreements as you get reconnected.  A great way to reconnect with the family is to find out what happened while you were away.  Then you can tell them about the positive things that happened during your deployment. </p>
        <p>Try these tips for reconnecting with family and friends:</p>
        <ul><li>Go to a sporting event, concert or a movie together</li>
        <li>Take a walk, hike, or a bike ride together</li>
        <li>Talk about your experience living in a different country</li>
        <li>Make a scrapbook of photo album of your lives together, with your deployments as one chapter in a larger story</li>
        <li>Ask your family what they did while you were gone, you might ask:
        <ul><li>“What were the best movies you saw?”</li>
        <li>“What music have you been listening to?”</li>
        <li>“Anything cool happen at work/school?”</li>
        <li>“What funny things have the kids done lately?”</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>1.3 Pay Attention to Positives</strong></p>
        <p>As you readjust to life with your family, it’s easy to focus on the bad instead of the good.  Do your best to notice the positive things family members do for you.</p>
        <ul ><li>Your partner bringing you a snack while you watch T.V.</li>
        <li>Your daughter drawing you a picture.</li>
        <li>Your mom offering to watch the kids so you can spend some “alone” time with your partner.</li>
        <li>Your son cleaning up his room without being told.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Noticing the small positives in life helps you feel better and your loved ones feel appreciated.  It’s also good to tell people you appreciate their behavior: "Thanks, I really appreciate how much you've helped me with this chore."</p>
        <p><strong>1.4 Talking About Deployment</strong></p>
        <p>Some service members just want to put their deployment experiences behind them.  But talking about those experiences with your family helps everyone.  Keep in mind that talking about your experiences doesn’t mean you have to tell people everything.  Here are suggestions for talking about your deployment without going into too much detail:</p>
        <ul><li>“I saw and did some really intense things that are hard for me to talk about.  Thanks for your patience.”</li>
        <li>“Sometimes my memories make me space out and I have a hard time concentrating.</li>
        <li>"I need you to just listen sometimes, and not interrupt me.”</li>
        <li>“I might need a few minutes to calm down—thanks for giving me some space.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your family may need support because they may be worried or upset about what happened to you.</p>
        <ul><li>Telling them what deployment was like for you.</li>
        <li>Telling them which deployment memories affect you now.</li>
        <li>Explaining that reminders of your deployment may make you distracted or tense.</li>
        <li>Reminding them how much you care about them.</li>
        <li>Enjoying fun activities together.</li>
        <li>Listening to them with an open mind, even when you have a different opinion.</li>
        <li>Acknowledging their feelings, “I know that this is hard for you too.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>1.5 Handling Conflict</strong></p>
        <p>Arguments can make it hard to talk to your partner about deployments.  It’s important to discuss problems in a way that builds up the relationship instead of tearing it down.  Here are some ideas for handling conflicts with a family member:</p>
        <ul><li><strong>Plan ahead. </strong> Schedule time to discuss the problem.  This gives both of you time to think about what to say.  Find a time when you can talk without distractions.</li>
        <li><strong>Identify your goal.  </strong>If your goal is to "win" the argument, your relationship will suffer.  Seek an outcome that will satisfy you both.  This usually requires compromises from both partners.</li>
        <li><strong>"I" Statements.  </strong>When you bring up an issue, don’t blame the other person.  Blame makes people defensive.  Instead, use “I” statements, telling the other person how you feel.</li>
        </ul><p >Instead of saying, "you never listen to me," say, "I feel frustrated when you read the newspaper while I’m talking."</p>
        <p >Instead of saying "That's ridiculous!" say, "I don't understand what you mean. Can you explain it again?"</p>
        <ul ><li><strong>Stick to one topic.  </strong>Bring up a specific issue that happened.  Tell the other person exactly what happened and why it bothered you.  Focus on resolving the issue, instead of bringing up other things.  Avoid saying "always” or “never”.</li>
        </ul><p >Instead of saying "You always nag me!" say, "Sometimes I need a few minutes to unwind after work."</p>
        <ul ><li><strong>Stay calm: </strong>When you get upset, you're less likely to think clearly, and you're more likely to say things that don't help the situation.  Stay calm, and you'll be better able to solve the problem.</li>
        </ul><p >To stay calm, take breaks during the discussion.  Practice relaxing by counting to 10, breathing slowly, or taking a brief walk to relieve tension.</p>
        <p >Be sure to tell your partner if you need a short break from the conversation so it doesn't seem like you're walking away.</p>
        <ul><li><strong>No "below the belt"</strong> <strong>shots</strong>.  Shouting, name-calling, foul language, threats, and sarcasm usually make arguments worse and make it harder to find common ground.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>1.6 Approaches That Do “More Harm Than Good”</strong></p>
        <p>Avoid <strong>criticizing</strong> and <strong>lashing out</strong> in anger during arguments.  Trying to control a conversation by demanding that others respond in a certain way won’t get you good results.  Finally, don’t expect others to solve problems for you<strong>.</strong>  You need to help find the solution.</p>
        <p><strong>1.7 Your Communication Plan</strong></p>
        <ul><li>Develop a "Communication Plan" to talk about deployment with your family. </li>
        <li>Decide ahead of time what you want to discuss.</li>
        <li>Share a little at a time, and then let the other person respond.</li>
        <li>Learn to endure painful feelings so you don't lash out while sharing.</li>
        <li>Listen without interrupting or getting defensive.</li>
        <li>Ask for feedback.</li>
        <li>Ask the other person to share their own feelings, experiences, and ways of coping.</li>
        <li>Own up to your feelings and behavior – don't blame others for how you feel.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After challenging and potentially life changing experiences like deployment, you may find that you want to spend time alone.  It’s natural to want some time to yourself.  If you had an intense combat experience (like being injured or witnessing a death of a friend), it may be difficult to get close to other people right now.  Or you may prefer to spend time only with “battle buddies”, avoiding friends who don’t share your deployment experiences.  These are all normal and common feelings held by many service members returning from deployment.</p>
        <p>There’s nothing wrong with spending some time alone, but isolating yourself from others can become a bad habit. To reconnect with your friends and community, we recommend that you work through the following sections in order:</p>
        <ol ><li>Overcome isolation</li>
        <li>Strengthen your network of relationships</li>
        <li>Share your deployment experiences</li>
        <li>Manage problem situations</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>2.1 Overcoming Isolation</strong></p>
        <p>After an intense experience like deployment, you may feel awkward and lonely around others.  You might keep to yourself because it allows you to avoid situations that bring up painful feelings or memories.  But if you cut yourself off from your friends, you won’t get the support you need and deserve.  Avoiding people can actually increase those upsetting thoughts and feelings.</p>
        <p><strong>2.2 Tips For Beating Isolation</strong></p>
        <p>You may have to push yourself to spend time with others. Remember that being around others is important for your well-being.</p>
        <ul ><li>Be intentional.  Plan to socialize with others.  Stick to your plan even when you’d rather be alone.</li>
        <li>Spend time with people you trust, in places where you are comfortable.</li>
        <li>Start with short outings, staying a little longer each time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>2.3 Strengthening Your Network</strong></p>
        <p>Returning service members often think they have little in common with their family and friends back home.  After such an intense, life-changing experience, you may think no one understands you.  But connecting with others helps you:</p>
        <ul ><li>Improve your mood</li>
        <li>Decrease your boredom</li>
        <li>Deal with painful thoughts and feelings about your deployment</li>
        <li>Find solutions to your problems</li>
        <li>Avoid harmful coping methods (like heavy drinking)</li>
        <li>REALIZE you are not alone<br type="_moz" /><br /> </li>
        </ul><p>It's important to strengthen your social network in the months following a deployment.  Some people like having a large and mixed social network.  Others prefer a smaller circle of friends.  Either way, it helps to have people you can count on when you need them.  Your social network includes:</p>
        <ul ><li>Family members and friends</li>
        <li>Neighbors</li>
        <li>Co-workers</li>
        <li>Community members such as members of church or sports league</li>
        <li>Professionals such as counselors, therapists and doctors</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>2.4 Expanding Your Network</strong></p>
        <p>Being with others gives you a sense of belonging and security, lifts your spirits, and eases your worries.  Don’t forget, you may be a source of comfort and friendship for others, too! </p>
        <p>Here are some things you can do to be part of your community and increase your social support network:</p>
        <ul ><li>Get some exercise.  Join a pick-up game.  Take and exercise class at a local gym or community center. Sports leagues and hiking groups are great ways to meet people while staying fit.  You could also try a new sport of physical activity.</li>
        <li>Get a hobby.  Find local people who share your interest in music, motorcycles, professional sports, cooking, and books</li>
        <li>Join a place of worship.  Joining a church, synagogue, mosque or temple can give you spiritual directions and help you become part of the community</li>
        <li>Join a professional group or neighborhood organization.  Get involved in a Neighborhood Watch group, or a group based on professional interests</li>
        <li>Volunteer.  Get involved in community service projects—clean up a local park or volunteer at a hospital</li>
        <li>Join a veteran's organization.  Groups such as the VA, the American Legion, and Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) are safe places to talk and fit in.  You’re probably eligible to join these groups, even if you’re currently active duty</li>
        <li>Join a cause.  Work with others toward a goal you believe in, such as an election or the protection of a natural area</li>
        </ul>

      content : `
        <p>Talking about your intense deployment experience can ease the impact of it.  Opening up about your deployment can be hard, so choose people who you trust to help and support you.  Friends, family members, chaplains, counselors and therapists can all provide support.</p>
        <p><strong>3.1 Sharing Your Deployment Experiences</strong></p>
        <p>The excuses listed are common and understandable.  You may need to coach yourself with self-talk. <br /><br />Below are positive ways to deal with these common excuses:</p>
        <p><strong>“I don’t want to be a burden.”</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Remember: People who care about you don’t see your problems as a burden.</li>
        <li>Ask yourself: “How do <em>I </em>feel when a close friend talks to me about something that bothers them?”</li>
        <li>Work through the most upsetting stuff together.<br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>“I think I should be over it by now.”</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Remember it takes time to heal.</li>
        <li>Looking for support can help you recover more quickly.</li>
        <li>Judging and criticizing yourself isn’t helpful and may make recovery harder.<br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>“I don’t want to be teased or made fun of.”</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Talk to someone you trust.</li>
        <li>Agree to keep the conversation private.<br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>“I’m afraid I’ll get so upset that I’ll lose control.”</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Go at your own pace and take breaks when you need to calm down.</li>
        <li>Practice your new relaxation skills when you’re upset<strong>.</strong><br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>“I don’t think it will be helpful.”</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Talk to someone to examine your own feelings.</li>
        <li>Facing your fears is healthier than avoiding them.<br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>“I think asking for help means I’m weak or going crazy.”</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Everyone needs support from time to time.</li>
        <li>Getting help shows strength, courage, and self-respect.</li>
        <li>Talking about things can be hard, but in the end you’ll feel better and stronger.<br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>“I don’t think anyone can understand.”</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Only if you <em>never</em> give anyone the chance to understand.</li>
        <li>You’re not alone; others have been through similar experiences.</li>
        <li>Ask others how they handle stressful experiences in their lives.</li>
        <li>Talk to a professional, such as psychologist or support group.<br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>“I’m worried that talking about it may affect my military career.”</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Talk to other service members with similar experiences.</li>
        <li>Agree to keep the conversation private.</li>
        <li>Know that in most cases, talking about your problems will help you overcome them.  But be aware that sharing some information could impact your career.  So share with someone you trust.<br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>“I think people might reject me if they know what I did during deployment.”</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Talk to other service members first, and then share with others you trust.</li>
        <li>Ask the other person to listen without judging.<br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>Remember: </strong>You did the best you could in the situation based on the information you had at the time.</p>
        <p><strong>3.2 How to Talk About Deployment</strong></p>
        <p>Not talking about deployment can increase upsetting thoughts and feelings.  It can limit your ability to understand what happened or deal with your feelings.  On the other hand, talking about your deployment all the time can be too much for you and others to handle.  Finding a balance between these extremes is the goal.</p>
        <ul ><li>How do you open up to others and strengthen your social ties?  Things you may want to talk about include:</li>
        <li>The actual events of your deployment</li>
        <li>Thoughts and feelings you have about those events</li>
        <li>Ways you’ve coped with your experiences</li>
        <li>Ways you’ve grown or changed since your deployment</li>
        <li>Practical decisions, such as what to do about your job</li>
        <li>Thoughts about your future</li>
        <li>Ways you found strength you didn't know you had</li>
        <li>Things you’ve learned that might help others to cope with similar experiences<br /> </li>
        </ul><p>You should also figure out the best times to talk about what happened.  It’s a good idea to wait to talk about your deployment until:</p>
        <ul ><li>You’re well rested</li>
        <li>You’re with someone you know and trust</li>
        <li>You’ve got enough time to share your thoughts and get feedback</li>
        <li>You’re not already feeling upset</li>
        <li>You’ve got some privacy<br /> </li>
        </ul><p>Other service members worry about getting emotional when talking about deployment.  If that worries you, remember these tips:</p>
        <ul ><li>It’s ok to get emotional.  Once you share, your emotions won’t seem as overwhelming</li>
        <li>Tell the person you may get emotional, and you’d appreciate their support if you do.</li>
        <li>Take a chance.  Talk about painful feelings or thoughts even if it’s hard.</li>
        <li>Expect some uncomfortable feelings after talking about hard issues.  Know that these feeling are easier to handle with time and practice.</li>
        <li>Inform the other person you may need to take a break to calm down or collect yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you finish talking:</p>
        <ul ><li>Thank the person for listening.  They should know you value their time and support.</li>
        <li>Schedule a cool-down time after talking.  Do something fun and easy to help shift back to the present.</li>
        <li>Plan to talk about your deployment with someone you trust.  Schedule your plan once a week or once a month.</li>
        <li>Expect the other person to respond in ways that bother or upset you.  If that happens, know that they probably don’t have bad intentions.  Talk with them about what bothered you, or ask someone else for their opinion.<br type="_moz" /><br /> </li>
        </ul><p><strong>We strongly encourage you to get help and support from a trained behavioral health professional if you:</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>Feel extremely sad or depressed for more than a week.</li>
        <li>Have anxious or distressing thoughts you can’t control for more than a week.</li>
        <li>Find it difficult to work or meet your daily responsibilities.</li>
        <li>Experience relationship problems, or have trouble taking care of your family.</li>
        <li>Increase your use of alcohol or drugs to cope.</li>
        <li>Overuse of prescription medications.</li>
        <li>Have traumatic stress reactions that do NOT get better as time passes.</li>
        <li>Think about hurting or killing yourself.</li>
        <li>Think about hurting or killing someone else.</li>

        <li>Have trouble sleeping most of the time.</li>
        <li>Have problems eating or lose significant weight without trying.</li>
        <li>Know others are concerned about you and think you should talk to someone.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>3.3 Talking to a Professional</strong></p>
        <p>Many service members find help in talking to a professional, such as a psychologist, counselor, spiritual advisor, doctor, or nurse.  Others join a support group of people with similar experiences.  The decision to seek professional counseling is a choice.  Remember, some situations require more professional help than others.<br /> </p>
        <p><strong>If you are feeling suicidal or homicidal, let someone know. Seek help immediately.  Call 911 or the Suicide Crisis hotline at 1-800-273-TALK.</strong><br /> </p>
        <p>It doesn’t have to be an emergency to get help from a professional therapist or counselor.  Experts who work with military personnel can help you:</p>
        <ul ><li>Manage your feelings and thoughts more effectively</li>

        <p>It is important that you recognize what triggered you.  It is also important to see how the trigger affected your emotions, physical reactions, and behaviors.  You will begin to see how trauma triggers are different from the original traumatic experience.  If you have strong feelings or sensations, you can start from there and work backwards to determine the trigger that set you off.</p>

        <p>You may face insensitive questions from people or feel that people do not want to listen to your experiences.  There are many helpful responses you can use to manage relationships with your family, friends, and community.<br type="_moz" /><br /> </p>
        <p><strong>4.1 Frustrating Questions</strong></p>
        <ul ><li>When you come back home someone may ask you, “Did you kill anyone?”, “What did you do over there?“ or “Are you screwed up now?”</li>
        <li>Because some questions may upset you, you should think of your response ahead of time.  Planning ahead will keep you from doing or saying anything you may regret.</li>
        <li>Let’s look at some responses to awkward questions:</li>
        <li>“No offense, but I don’t like to talk about my deployment</li>
        <li>“I’m not comfortable answering those questions right now, but I appreciate your interest.”</li>
        <li>“Oh, let’s not go there.  Let’s talk about something else.”</li>
        <li>“Let’s talk about this another time.”</li>
        <li>“I have a lot of strong opinions on that subject.  Do you have time to listen?”</li>
        <li>“That’s not a cool thing to say (or ask)”</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>4.2 Unhelpful Responses</strong></p>
        <p>Sometimes you may get a sense from people that you shouldn’t talk about your deployment.  You may think they want you to just forget about your experiences or keep your feelings to yourself.  You might think they don’t care about your thoughts or feelings. Remember, it is possible that they are struggling with their own thoughts and feelings about what you’re saying. </p>
        <p><br />Unhelpful responses from your listener:</p>
        <ul ><li>Seems too bus to talk</li>
        <li>Acts uncomforable wen you talk to them about your experiences</li>
        <li>Doesn't understand what you mean</li>
        <li>Complains about their own problems instead of listening to you</li>
        <li>Tries to fix the problem instead of listening</li>
        <li>Responds by saying "Forget it, it's in the past." or "Just ge over it."</li>
        <li>Reacts with shock or judes your behavior</li>
        <li>Criicizes your feelings or the ways tha you havbe coping</li>
        <li>Criticizes you for what you di while deployed<br /> </li>
        </ul><p>Some Ways to Respond to Unhelpful Responses:</p>
        <ul ><li>When others don’t respond in a helpful way, take steps to let them know what you need.</li>
        <li>Remember they care but may have trouble showing it.</li>
        <li>Tell them what they can do to help.</li>
        <li>Let them know how you feel when they don’t listen.</li>
        <li>Tell them specifically what they’re doing that makes it hard to talk to them.</li>
        <li>Remember that most people don’t know much about war and the military.</li>
        <li>Walk away.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>4.3 Dealing with Problem Behaviors From Others</strong></p>
        <p>Unfortunately, some people in your social network back home may be negative, critical, or more unhelpful than supportive.  These people exhibit “problem behavior” such as:</p>
        <ul ><li>Blaming you or telling you it’s your fault</li>
        <li>Criticizing you for what happened</li>
        <li>Making fun of your reactions</li>
        <li>Refusing to listen to feedback about how their behavior affects you</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Warning signs you may be with someone with problem behaviors that could be a problem for you:</p>
        <ul ><li>You feel irritable after spending time with this person</li>
        <li>You feel pressured by this person to use illegal substances or drink excessively</li>
        <li>You notice the person keeps changing the subject or ignoring what’s important</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Learn how to handle people who antagonize you by:</p>
        <ul ><li>Reducing the time you spend socializing with them</li>
        <li>Bring a supportive person with you when you spend time around them</li>
        <li>Avoid discussions that involve upsetting or other private issues</li>
        <li>Remember that taking care of yourself is your top priority</li>
        <li>Set limits: ask them to stop if they are being rude, prying, or critical</li>
        </ul>

      title : '1.0 Introduction to Anxiety',
      content : `
        <p>Anxiety can be described as motivation, excitement, tension, anticipation,  stress, worry, nerves, and phobias. Anxiety can be a normal reaction to new and positive challenges or to stressful events.  
        But, anxiety can also be the result of distorted thinking and other controllable causes; if not  controlled, anxiety  can become problematic and  interfere with  your health and wellness.</p>
        <p>Anxiety is a mix of thoughts, emotions and physical reactions.  People describe experiencing “butterflies” or “knots” in their bellies, or a pounding heart, or chest tightness.  
        Anxiety can be useful, signaling the body to go “on alert” and prepare for action.  Anxiety can be a motivator or a response to the anticipation of an event.  
        Anxiety can signal a person to act, which can facilitate coping with a difficult situation.</p>
        <p>Worry is the thinking part of anxiety in which the worrier regularly predicts the occurrence of negative or catastrophic events in his life or in the life of loved ones. Worried thinking often leads anxiety’s physical symptoms (rapid heartbeat, restlessness, disrupted sleep, etc.).</p>
        <p>Everyone worries about something at one time or another. But, worry becomes problematic when it is chronic and interferes with daily living.&nbsp; It becomes a cycle that is difficult to break and may cause you to make significant lifestyle changes like isolating yourself or avoiding public places.&nbsp; Worried thinking focuses on the likelihood of negative outcomes without realistic efforts to plan or problem solve.&nbsp; Worry is about living in the future by always thinking “What if?”<br>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Here are some signs that worry might be problematic in your life:</p>
        <ul><li>Here are some signs that worry might be problematic in your life:</li>
        <li>You are chronically on alert and thinking about potential future dangers or threats</li>
        <li>You are consistently making negative predictions about the future</li>
        <li>You tend to overestimate the likelihood that something bad will happen</li>
        <li>You repeat worried thoughts over and over again in your head</li>
        </ul><p><br><strong>Here is an example of worry leading to anxiety:</strong></p>
        <p><em>Jim hopes to be promoted at his job.&nbsp; He has been in the same position for five years and has been working hard.&nbsp; He was deployed for 12 months and has returned to work.&nbsp; Since returning from deployment, he has received consistently positive feedback and yearly reviews from his employer.&nbsp; Jim passed the preliminary review for the promotion, and has a formal, in-person interview coming up.&nbsp; Jim is worried (predicting) that he will not get the job, even though he believes that he is the most qualified candidate for the position.&nbsp; Jim thinks he will be too anxious to accurately answer the interviewer’s questions, even though he has been preparing himself for two weeks.&nbsp; He finds himself wondering: “What if my mind goes blank? What if they view my deployment negatively? What if the roads are icy and I can’t get to the interview on time? What if I spill coffee on myself the morning before the interview?” Every time he thinks (worries) about the interview his heart races, his palms sweat and he has butterflies (anxiety).</em><br><br><br>This example shows how worried thinking can lead to anxiety. Even though Jim is qualified for the position and has been preparing for the interview, he has been focusing most of his attention on the future (e.g. “What if?”) and the catastrophic outcomes to follow.&nbsp; He has not engaged in any planning or problem solving.<br><br><br><strong>Another example:</strong></p>
        <p><em>Steve is scheduled to compete in a national karate competition in two weeks.&nbsp; His military training has mentally prepared him, and the required PT has kept him in shape. He has practiced.&nbsp; His friends and family will be traveling from around the country to watch him compete.&nbsp; He doesn’t want to let them, his coach or himself down.&nbsp; His motivation and excitement cause him to practice more frequently and review videos from previous competitions to gain new insight and improve his techniques.</em><br><br><br>This example shows how worry can be constructive. Steve’s thinking does not involve predicting catastrophic outcomes.&nbsp; Rather, he interprets his body’s arousal as motivation and excitement, leading him toward planning and problem solving strategies. These include continued practice and review of his previous competitions to improve his technique.</p>

      content : `
        <p>Experiencing some degree of anxiety in life is normal. However, anxiety becomes a problem when it is overwhelming and causes significant change to your lifestyle or relationships. An anxiety disorder can keep a person from coping with life’s ups and downs and make a person feel anxious most of the time, sometimes without any identifiable cause.</p>
        <div class="field-item even"><p>Anxious feelings may be so uncomfortable that an individual will do anything to avoid the feelings, including stopping or changing everyday activities.&nbsp; Anxiety becomes an “anxiety disorder” when it significantly interferes with common daily activities.&nbsp; For example, severe anxiety can prevent a person from going to work or engaging in meaningful activities with friends and family.</p>

        <p>The body will also react to anxiety that lacks an actual “cause.”&nbsp; For example, during a panic attack, there may be physical symptoms such as dizziness, blurred vision, numbness, tingling, stiff muscles, and breathlessness, possibly all in response to an imagined threat.&nbsp; Even though there is no actual threat, the body’s reactions are interpreted as life-threatening even though they are not dangerous.&nbsp; This is called catastrophic thinking.&nbsp; An individual with catastrophic thinking can get caught up in a vicious cycle: physical symptoms lead to anxiety, and anxiety ‘feeds’ back into the physical symptoms, worsening the intensity of those symptoms.&nbsp; This has the net effect of increasing the tendency to make catastrophic predictions<br>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In addition, catastrophic and hopeless thoughts about never being able to control the anxiety make the situation worse and can cause depression by increasing a sense of hopelessness.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Severe anxiety can prevent a person from going to work or engaging in meaningful activities with friends and family.  Anyone can be affected by problems with anxiety.  In fact, as many as 25% of all adults in America experience intense levels of anxiety at some time in life.  Individuals with one type of anxiety disorder are at a greater risk for other types of anxiety disorders and related problems.</p>
        <div class="field-item even"><p>There are many different types of anxiety disorders. One of the best ways of learning about anxiety disorders is to hear people describe their experiences.&nbsp; Here are several types of anxiety disorders and some examples of real people describing their experiences with some of the most common types:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</strong></p>
        <p>GAD is defined as worrying constantly about small or large concerns.&nbsp; GAD is usually accompanied by physical symptoms like restlessness, fatigue, irritability, and trouble sleeping.<br>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Examples of GAD: </strong></p>
        <p>Anna, age 38:&nbsp; “Here’s an example of how my worry just takes over.&nbsp; My son is late coming home from school.&nbsp; I panic, thinking the worst—he’s in trouble.&nbsp; I’m overwhelmed by anxiety and become restless, unable to focus on anything else and unable to relax.”<br>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Carlos, age 27:&nbsp; “I worry even when nothing happens.&nbsp; I can be sitting somewhere comfortable;, somewhere I’ve sat before many, many times.&nbsp; Nothing has ever gone wrong, but I feel like something is going to happen.&nbsp; I have a gut feeling that an impending doom is going to manifest itself very soon, or that something somewhere is not right.&nbsp; It’s as if I can sense that something bad is going to happen soon or is currently happening somewhere else, but it never does.”<br>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sonya, age 22: “I’ve come to a realization that I think I’ve had a problem with worry for a long time.&nbsp; It hasn’t been debilitating and I’ve never had a full-out panic attack.&nbsp; It seems to come and go. Some days I’ll feel totally relaxed and at ease, other days I’ll feel SO nervous and edgy for absolutely no reason.”<br>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lynn, age 42: “I tend to be a general worrier.&nbsp; One thing that really gets me is that I find myself scared to take medication, not just for anxiety but I am scared to take anything after I read the potential side effects.&nbsp; If I find myself so miserable that I break down and take the medication I start having so much anxiety over what might happen I don’t know if it’s worth it.&nbsp; Also I become so aware of any new feeling in my body and worry it’s the meds.&nbsp; This is really a pain to live like this.&nbsp; The older I get the more this is becoming a big issue.”<br>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Maria, age 39: “As long as I can remember I have ALWAYS been a worry wart…when I was younger it was about not too serious issues, but now that I am an adult I constantly worry about major issues and decisions in my life.”<br>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>What a Provider Might Ask to Evaluate for Generalized Anxiety Disorder:</strong></p>
        <ul><li>During the last six months, have you found that you have persistent worry or anxiety about a variety of different things (e.g., safety, money, health, work, family, school, etc.) most of the time and more often than other people?</li>
        <li>Do you find it difficult to control your worrying or does it interfere with your ability to function in important areas of your life?</li>
        <li>Does your frequent worrying or anxiety cause physical symptoms such as feeling keyed up, restlessness, fatigue/tired, muscle tension, poor concentration, or difficulty sleeping,&nbsp;etc. (for more days than not during the past six months)?<br>&nbsp;</li>
        </ul><p><strong>Panic Disorder</strong></p>
        <p>Panic Disorder is characterized by recurrent panic attacks which involve sudden feelings of fear and terror for no obvious reason.&nbsp; Panic attacks can happen without warning and are usually accompanied by physical symptoms such as difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, dizziness or chest pain.<br>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Examples of Panic Disorder:</strong></p>
        <p>David, age 29: “I get scared that I'm about to die, heart palpitations, dizziness, feeling like nothing is real, I feel like I can't breathe good...like I can't take a deep breath. Those are just a few of the symptoms I get.&nbsp; For some reason night time is really bad for me.&nbsp; When I am going to bed I worry that I will die in my sleep and then I start getting heart palpitations and all the other symptoms.&nbsp; Yesterday was especially bad for me.&nbsp; I always feel like I won't make it to the next day."<br><br>Nicole, age 21:&nbsp;&nbsp; “I feel like mine are more than these attacks because of how horrible I feel and how unaware I am of things.&nbsp; I don't really panic and get the heart palps as much, just feel really ill like I'm going to die and very hopeless. I get nauseous, dizziness, cold sweats, trembling when yawning (weird I know), sometimes a feeling of restless legs, headache, sweaty palms, basically I just feel like death.”<br>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>What a Provider Might Ask in Evaluating for Panic Disorder:</strong></p>
        <ul><li>In the past month have you had periods of extreme anxiety and/or fright (panic attacks)?</li>
        <li>In the past month have you had uncomfortable physical symptoms including rapid heartbeat, chest pains, sweating, shakiness, dizziness, or shortness of breath?</li>
        <li>Have you developed a fear of having a panic attack?</li>
        <li>Have you experienced any changes from your usual behavior?</li>
        <li>Do you fear dying or losing control?<br>&nbsp;</li>
        </ul><p><strong>Social Anxiety Disorder</strong></p>
        <p>Social Anxiety Disorder or (Social Phobia) is characterized by marked anxiety in social situations in which the individual unusually and excessively fears being criticized or scrutinized by others.<br><br><strong>Examples of Social Anxiety Disorder:</strong></p>
        <p>Tom, age 24: “Sometimes when I say or do something really stupid in front of people, I start putting myself down and cussing myself out when I’m alone.&nbsp; It could be something really simple like saying the wrong thing or saying something that I think doesn’t make any sense at all and realizing that right after saying it.&nbsp; Why can’t I be as witty as other people when communicating?&nbsp; I find myself always saying stupid things and feeling stupid after saying it.&nbsp; I hate the way I am and how I always embarrass myself in front of people for little things.”</p>
        <p>Sara, age 19: “I always have seemed to feel anxious in social situations.&nbsp; Especially when I do not know the people well.&nbsp; It seems I cannot function in large groups, being more comfortable in smaller groups of 10 or fewer people. I worry a lot about social situations.&nbsp; I turn down invitations to social events and avoid situations that make my anxiety unbearable.&nbsp; It’s like my spider sense is always tingling for no reason.”<br><br>Lenore, age 26: “I have absolutely no self-confidence, and just thinking about social gatherings makes me feel depressed about myself.&nbsp; If I have a couple of weeks to prepare myself, I can drag through alright.&nbsp; But even going to parties with people I know, or running into someone I know is difficult.”</p>
        <p>Tina, age 29: “I dread going out for dinner in groups larger than about six.&nbsp; I hate sitting around the table trying to think of something to talk about that isn’t boring, worrying that people think I’m boring and feeling that everyone is noticing that no one is talking to me — trying and failing to catch someone’s attention by speaking to them and feeling really stupid…thinking everyone else is wittier and funnier than me.”</p>
        <p>Gino, age 35: “I feel very self-conscious about blushing.&nbsp; The slightest little dig or comment towards me results in my face going bright red and I can feel myself start sweating, basically making me look like a fool.&nbsp; This also happens in other situations such as walking into a place with lots of people around, or doing things like talking one on one to someone I don’t know that well.”<br>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>What a Provider Might Ask in Evaluating for Social Anxiety:</strong></p>
        <ul><li>In the past month, did you have an intense fear of embarrassment or being criticized by others in social, occupational, or performance situations (e.g., eating in front of people, speaking in front of others, talking to people you did not know, dating, attending parties or social gatherings, etc.)?</li>
        <li>In the past month, did you avoid or feel extremely anxious or distressed in any feared social, occupational, or performance situations?</li>
        <li>In the past month, did your intense fear of being embarrassed or criticized by other people in social, occupational, or performance situations cause an inability to function?</li>

          <ul><li><strong>Alcohol abuse:</strong> Many people who feel anxious use alcohol to try to calm down and cope with anxious feelings, especially in social situations.&nbsp; However, alcohol can make anxiety and panic symptoms worse.<br>&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong>Depression:</strong> Those with anxiety disorders are commonly affected by depression, and approximately half of those individuals diagnosed with depression also have symptoms of anxiety disorders.&nbsp; This is often caused by a sense of loss of control when an anxiety disorder causes significant disruption in life.&nbsp; When the anxiety disorder is treated successfully, the depression often improves as well.<br>&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong>Eating disorders:</strong> Individuals with eating disorders spend a lot of time focused on their weight, appearance, food intake, and exercise. They often have an intense and unusual fear of gaining weight. Contrary to eating too little, some people who experience symptoms of anxiety eat, and potentially overeat, to calm themselves. Repeating this pattern over time can lead to weight gain and obesity.<br>&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong>Medical conditions:</strong> Anxiety problems can lead to a dependence on anxiety medications.&nbsp; In addition, anxiety can cause a person to avoid medical treatment and dental procedures; on the opposite side of the spectrum, their unrealistic fear of disease may lead them to engage in unnecessary, and sometimes dangerous, medical tests and procedures.<br>&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong>Sleep Problems:</strong> The symptoms associated with anxiety like racing thoughts, racing heart can interfere with getting to sleep and staying asleep.</li>

        <div class="field-item even"><p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">Recognizing that life circumstances can worsen is an important first step toward reducing anxiety.&nbsp; In this section you will learn a little more about the following factors:</p>
          <ul><li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Stress</li>
          <li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Caffeine and Other Stimulants</li>
          <li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Problems Being Assertive</li>

          <li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Poor Coping Skills</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Stress affects everyone; however, overwhelming stress can result in anxiety, especially for people who are vulnerable or actively diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.</p>
          <p><strong>Relationship/Family stress</strong>: Relationships with significant others and family members can be a great source of support.&nbsp; 
          When these relationships become strained, which frequently happens following a deployment, the support gained from those relationships is affected.&nbsp; 
          This can cause an increase in stress and worries.</p>
          <p><strong>Deployment stress:</strong>&nbsp; The uncertainties created by deployment can cause significant stress.&nbsp; 
          These uncertainties affect both the deployed and those who are left at home.&nbsp; Increased responsibilities, less support, and changed roles can increase the likelihood of worry and anxiety.</p>
          <p>
          <strong>Job stress:</strong> Returning from a deployment often means returning to a different kind of work or starting a new job.&nbsp; These changes can be very stressful and can make anxiety worse.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Cutting back on caffeine or going “cold turkey” can cause a slight increase in anxiety and physical symptoms (e.g. headaches) at first, but this will decrease as your body adjusts.</p>
          <p>Nicotine in cigarettes or smokeless tobacco can also increase anxiety.&nbsp; If you use caffeine and/or nicotine regularly, you might not even realize their impact on your mood.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Assertive communication is expressing thoughts and feelings in a non-threatening and non-aggressive manner.  Expressing feelings to others often involves some level of personal assertiveness so that thoughts and feelings can be directly and honestly communicated.  Individuals who are not assertive typically believe that their requests or ideas will not be respected and valued, leading to and maintaining feelings of anxiety.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="field-item even">
        <p>Anxiety often affects an individual’s ability to think clearly and discriminate between rational and irrational thoughts.&nbsp; Here are some examples of distorted thinking that can make anxiety worse:<br><br><strong>All-or-Nothing Thinking:</strong> Thinking in terms of either/or, black-and-white, good or bad, right or wrong<br><br><strong>Exaggerating or Minimizing:</strong> Exaggerating is making too big of a deal out of a negative experience, or making things much more negative than they really are.&nbsp; Exaggerated thinking is also compared to “making a mountain out of a molehill” or “blowing things way out of proportion.”&nbsp; Minimizing means not giving oneself or others enough credit for doing something good.&nbsp; Too little is made out of something, such as a compliment or success.<br><br><strong>Overgeneralizing:</strong> Overgeneralization involves thinking that something that happened once or twice will keep happening again and again, especially if it is something bad.<br><br><strong>Mental Filter:</strong> Using a mental filter means only seeing the bad and not the good side of things. The positive is forgotten or ignored, and only the bad things are considered.<br><br><strong>Not accepting the positive:</strong> People with this thinking error reject anything positive, especially positive information about themselves.<br><br><strong>Reasoning with feelings instead of logic or facts:</strong> Saying, “I feel like a loser, so I must be a loser,” is an example of using feelings instead of facts as proof of truth.<br><br><strong>Jumping to Conclusions:</strong> This type of thinking error happens when people think they know what will happen without first finding out the facts. Expecting something bad to happen usually goes along with this type of thinking. Mind-reading is another way of jumping to conclusions. An example of mind-reading is when a person thinks he knows what others are thinking, without finding out the truth first. Mind-reading often results in incorrectly believing what the other person is thinking.<br><br><strong>Labeling:</strong> A person can label&nbsp;his or herself, or label others, based on very little information or based on mistakes that were made. When people label themselves they often do so harshly. This has the effect of making it harder to accept mistakes. And, once the labels get “attached,” they become difficult to remove.<br><br><strong>“Should” Statements:</strong> “Should” statements are based on rules or standards that people set up for themselves and others to follow, but are usually impossible to do all of the time. People sometimes set the standards so high that they set themselves and others up to fail, which only confirms the negative thoughts.<br><br><strong>Taking it personally:</strong> Taking things too personally involves the assumption that others do negative things on purpose. People who take things too personally may also tend to take responsibility for something that they’re not responsible for.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Anxiety is unlikely to resolve or improve when effective coping skills are absent.  Coping skills help individuals deal with a problem or with general life stress. When a person doesn’t know how to cope with life stress, his or her anxiety can increase. Poor coping skills include things like avoiding or denying the problem, drinking or drugging, not asking for help, and self-blaming.</p>

      title : '6.0 Understanding Panic Disorder',
      content : `
        <div class="field-item even"><p>&nbsp;Panic Disorders are extremely common in the civilian population.&nbsp; People who suffer from panic attacks often mistake the symptoms for a severe illness.&nbsp; For example, heart attack, stroke, severe mental illness, lung and breathing problems, or brain tumors.&nbsp; While panic symptoms can be uncomfortable and certainly are a nuisance, it’s important to understand that they are not dangerous, they can’t hurt you.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, once people stop fearing their symptoms, they tend to go away. Due to combat and re-integration experiences, service members and veterans have a high likelihood of experiencing physical symptoms of anxiety and then developing catastrophic thinking about the meaning of the symptoms.<br>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Many people experience feelings of panic.&nbsp; It is normal and healthy to feel a sense of panic when under fire by the enemy or when a child goes missing while playing at the park.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, nobody interprets the symptoms as an illness.&nbsp; People expect to feel this way in a crisis and the physical sensations go away as soon as the crisis is over.&nbsp; When an actual crisis is present, the physical symptoms signal the body to go ‘on alert’ and prepare for the fight-or-flight response.&nbsp; It was designed to allow&nbsp;humans to protect themselves by confronting the problem (fight) or by removing themselves from the dangerous situation (flight).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>However, panic attacks can occur when serious situations are not present.&nbsp; When they come “out of the blue” (i.e. without explanation) the physical sensations can be frightening.&nbsp; The physical symptoms of panic are often uncomfortable and produce fear when catastrophic thinking takes over.&nbsp; Because of this, individuals with panic begin to avoid situations in which others might see them or in which they might not be able to escape.&nbsp; Individuals may also avoid physical activities (including formal and informal exercise) that can cause physical responses similar to those experienced in panic.<br>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Remember that many people experience feelings of panic and can mistake their symptoms as illness.&nbsp; Let’s take a closer look at the differences between a Panic Attack and a Panic Disorder.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Panic Attack</strong></p>
          <p>A panic attack occurs when an abrupt surge of intense fear or discomfort in which four (or more) of these symptoms develop quickly and reach a peak within minutes.</p>
          <ul><li>Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate</li>
          <li>Sweating</li>
          <li>Trembling or shaking</li>
          <li>Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering</li>
          <li>Feeling of choking chest pain or discomfort</li>
          <li>Nausea or abdominal distress</li>
          <li>Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint</li>
          <li>De-realization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself)</li>
          <li>Fear of losing control or going crazy</li>
          <li>Fear of dying</li>
          <li>Paresthesia (numbness or tingling sensations)</li>
          <li>Chills or hot flashes<br>&nbsp;</li>
          </ul><p><strong>Panic Disorder</strong></p>
          <p>A panic disorder is specified when unexpected panic attacks happen more than once and the following symptoms and conditions occur:</p>
          <ul><li>Recurrent, unexpected panic attacks</li>
          <li>At least one of the panic attacks followed by one month or more of persistent concern about having additional attacks and/or worry about the implications of the attack or its consequences (e.g., losing control, having a heart attack, "going crazy")</li>
          <li>A significant change in behavior related to the attacks</li>
          </ul><p><br>A panic disorder is indicated if the panic attacks are not due to the effects of a substance (e.g., drug of abuse, medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism), and the panic attacks are not better accounted for by another mental disorder, such as social anxiety (e.g., occurring on exposure to feared social situations), Specific Phobia (e.g., exposure to a specific phobic situation), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (e.g., exposing someone to dirt with an obsession about contamination), or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (e.g., in response to stimuli associated with a severe stressor, or in response to separation from attachment figures, as in separation anxiety).</p>

        <h3>What Happens to Thoughts During Panic?</h3>
        <div class="field-item even"><p>People who have panic attacks often feel as if they are the only ones in the world with the problem, the worries that accompany panic attacks have similarities.&nbsp; Catastrophic thoughts associated with panic disorder are usually about misinterpreting physical symptoms as life threatening.&nbsp; Catastrophic thoughts that are a response to the physical symptoms, often keep the panic symptoms going.&nbsp; Here are some examples of catastrophic thoughts related to panic symptoms.</p>

          <td style="width: 488px; height: 75px;">
          <p style="text-align: center;">Although it may not feel like it at the time, the heart is designed to react in the way it does during a panic attack.&nbsp; It can feel unnatural because an increase in heart rate is usually reserved for vigorous activity.&nbsp; When it happens out of the blue it can be scary.</p>

          <td style="width: 488px; height: 78px;">
          <p style="text-align: center;">It may not feel pleasant, but you are less likely to suffocate during a panic attack than at any other time because you naturally take in more air.&nbsp; The shortness of breath you may feel is due to your body increasing its demand for oxygen or because of hyperventilation.</p>
          </td>
          </tr><tr><td style="width: 244px; height: 78px;">

          <td style="width: 488px; height: 78px;">
          <p style="text-align: center;">Fainting is caused by a drop in blood pressure.&nbsp; During a panic attack your heart is racing and your blood pressure increases.&nbsp; As a result, it is highly unlikely that panic will cause fainting.&nbsp; Fear of fainting often comes about due to the sense of dizziness which accompanies hyperventilation.</p>

          <td style="width: 488px; height: 64px;">
          <p style="text-align: center;">Those who have nervous breakdowns or go crazy probably are not aware of it. Thinking that you are going crazy is a catastrophic thought in response to the physical symptoms of panic.</p>

          <td style="width: 488px; height: 75px;">
          <p style="text-align: center;">During a panic attack, it can feel like you have lost control.&nbsp; In fact, all that has happened is that you are unable to stop your physical symptoms on demand.&nbsp; In fact, the more you fight them, the worse they get.&nbsp; When you stop trying to control, fight, and fear them, they tend to go away.</p>

          <td style="width: 488px; height: 89px;">
          <p style="text-align: center;">During a panic attack, it is very common and quite natural to worry that your body can't take care of what is happening and that others will see your experience as weird or strange.&nbsp; Because when you are so focused on your symptoms, you likely can’t see that others are not paying attention to you.&nbsp; Research has shown that other people usually can’t tell when someone is having a panic attack.</p>

        <h3>How a Counselor or Therapist Can Help with Panic</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
        <p>Here are ways a counselor or therapist can help you with symptoms of panic:</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong>Reality checks/undoing distorted thinking: </strong>Cognitive distortions and automatic negative thoughts underlie panic.&nbsp; Therapists help an individual to first become aware of the distorted thinking and then to undo it by finding better, more realistic ways to think about a situation. &nbsp;The most important thoughts to change are those that say “these symptoms are dangerous”.&nbsp; Although panic symptoms are uncomfortable and certainly are a nuisance, they can’t hurt you; they are not symptoms of a life threatening illness.&nbsp; As fear of symptoms reduces, the symptoms tend to go away.&nbsp; A therapist can help you learn to tolerate symptoms without fearing them until they go away.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong>Breathing techniques: </strong>Therapists teach clients how to notice their breathing during an anxious and panicky time. Breathing techniques are introduced and practiced in session.&nbsp; These breathing strategies can prevent hyperventilation and help an individual to cope with a difficult situation by calming the body and reducing overall stress.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong>Exposure/non-avoidance: </strong>Panic attacks are often a reaction to facing physical symptoms that are deemed as threatening or dangerous.&nbsp; An individual reacts to such a threat by avoiding the people, ideas, and locations associated with the onset of symptoms.&nbsp; This avoidance behavior only makes the situation worse.&nbsp; A therapist will help a client learn how to seek out feared physical symptoms on purpose by entering places where the symptoms tend to happen.&nbsp; Learning that even uncomfortable physical symptoms won’t lead to a heart attack or fainting is one of the keys to getting over Panic Disorder.</p>

        <p>Anxiety symptoms are wide-ranging and affect people in most areas of their lives so it is no surprise that anxiety can affect relationships with family, significant others, and friends.  
        Anxiety disorders can be stressful for family members too.</p>
        <div class="field-item even"><p><strong>Social Isolation</strong></p>
        <p>Those with anxiety disorders often avoid engaging with others because of fear of embarrassing themselves. This can put a strain on significant others and on children. Those with the anxiety disorder may want to be alone and may not want to engage in activities outside the house with family and friends.&nbsp; In addition to avoiding others, they often avoid stressful situations or public places. This avoidance can greatly inhibit daily activities and reduce the number and quality of interactions with others.<br><br><strong>Chronic Tension</strong></p>
        <p>People with anxiety disorders often feel restless and tense. Family members often feel that tension and may not know how to respond. They may feel as if they are “walking on eggshells” around the individual with the anxiety disorder. Tension in the family can cause problems bonding and communicating.</p>

      content : `
        <p>There are many strategies and techniques that can be used to help cope with worry and anxiety. Some involve strategies to help reduce physical symptoms of anxiety directly through methods like muscle relaxation, imagery, or breathing exercises.  Other strategies are designed to teach worriers to change catastrophic thinking so that imagining worse case scenarios and predictions of disaster are either reduced or such thoughts aren’t taken seriously.  
        Treatment strategies used by professional health care providers usually address both problems.</p>
        <h3>Getting Professional Help for Anxiety and Worry</h3>
        <div class="field-item even"><p><strong>Getting professional help</strong></p>
        <p>Not all professionals such as physicians, psychologists, counselors, social workers, and psychiatrists are trained to treat anxiety disorders.&nbsp; If you seek professional help for managing anxiety, it is important to find out whether the professional you are talking to has specialized training in treating anxiety disorders.&nbsp; If not, try to find someone who specializes in treating anxiety.&nbsp; One online resource for identifying specialists in your area is the Anxiety and Depression Association of America.</p>
        <p><strong>Psychotherapy</strong></p>
        <p>Therapists use a variety of techniques to help their clients with anxiety.&nbsp; Techniques and strategies that work for one person might not work for another.&nbsp; So, it is important to be able to communicate with a therapist about what is or is not working.&nbsp; Some of the most common therapies for treating anxiety are Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy<strong> </strong>(CBT) and Exposure Therapy.&nbsp;<br><br>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy is a treatment that focuses on how thoughts and feelings influence behavior.&nbsp; CBT teaches individuals to recognize when their thoughts are unrealistic and contribute to anxiety. The therapist works with the client to change irrational thoughts and beliefs to more realistic thoughts and to determine what behaviors are the result of the unrealistic thoughts.&nbsp; Positive changes in thoughts and behaviors are likely to result in reduced anxiety.<br><br>Exposure therapy is a treatment strategy in which a therapist works with a client to seek out, under controlled conditions, anxiety producing situations that the client finds frightening.&nbsp; By doing so, individuals learn that neither the feared situation nor the physical symptoms that can occur are dangerous and that other catastrophic thoughts are not accurate.&nbsp; With practice, the fear of situations or physical symptoms gradually evaporates over time.<br><br><strong>Medication</strong></p>
        <p>There are a number of medications available that are sometimes used for treating anxiety. These medications change how brain chemicals called neurotransmitters are produced or used.&nbsp; How effective a medication will be for any one person depends on factors such as body type, drug sensitivity and side effects. Research indicates that medications for anxiety, especially for panic disorder, are more beneficial when they are combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).&nbsp; The doctor who prescribes medications needs to monitor mood and health closely to determine if the medications are having the desired benefit.</p>

        <h3>Things You Can Do for Yourself to Manage Physical Effects of Anxiety</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Self-help exercises are powerful tools for calming the mind and body, but shouldn't be used to avoid anxious thoughts. Mind-body exercises work best when anxious thoughts have been addressed first.</p>

        <h3>Things You Can Do for Yourself to Manage Worried Thinking</h3>
        <div class="field-item even"><p><u><strong>How to Change Worried Thinking</strong></u></p>
          <p>People who worry frequently tend to overestimate the risk of specific situations.&nbsp; They view a situation as being more risky than it actually is.&nbsp; Most worriers focus their time and attention on the worst case scenarios and then engage in catastrophic thinking, which only makes the problems and worries seem worse. If you spend most of your time and energy worrying, you tend to forget that you have the ability to cope with many stressful events.&nbsp; Learning to accurately assess risk can greatly reduce anxiety.</p>

Anxiety is created when we say “possible”, but we mean “probable” or “likely”.&nbsp; Because anything is possible it’s easy to create fear by thinking anything is probable.&nbsp; While it’s possible that you could be killed the next time you drive your car, it’s not probable or likely based on your own personal experience on the road.&nbsp; If you learn to accurately assess risk and challenge unrealistic thinking, you can reduce anxiety.<br><br><strong>Examine the facts; what actually happened: </strong>Pay<strong> </strong>attention to what actually happens in life, rather than what could happen, might happen, or almost happened, is a powerful way of confirming for yourself that the world is not as dangerous as it could be.&nbsp; While bad things can happen, most of the time they don’t, and it’s worth paying attention to that as you go through life.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Stop fighting anxiety:</strong>&nbsp; This may seem wrong, but research has shown that trying to fight anxiety, both anxious thoughts and the physical effects, is not a permanent answer to ending anxiety. Whether you use distraction, avoidance or attempts at escape, or the more useful strategies such as breathing exercises and progressive relaxation, they rarely will stop anxious thoughts or symptoms permanently, they always seem return.&nbsp;<br><br>What we know about behavior is “What you resist, persists."&nbsp; Instead of trying to resist worried thinking, focus on the fact that the symptoms of anxiety and panic attacks may be uncomfortable but they can’t hurt you.&nbsp; Learning not to fear these symptoms allows them to have much less of an impact.<br><br><strong>Exposure exercises: </strong>Prove to yourself that your symptoms from anxiety and panic can't hurt!&nbsp; Of course that can be somewhat frightening if you really believe that the situation is dangerous.&nbsp; Exposure usually involves confronting your fear by entering a feared situation (e.g., a crowded restaurant, a tall building, a social gathering) and staying in the situation while practicing realistic thinking (“No one is attacking me”, “I’m not going to die”, “This isn’t hurting me”).&nbsp; Over time, catastrophic thinking is eliminated because nothing harmful (other than some uncomfortable anxiety symptoms) actually happens.&nbsp; With practice the anxiety symptoms go away.&nbsp; Exposure is best learned with the help of a trained therapist, but can be practiced on your own once you learn how. Sometimes it is hard to pinpoint your trigger.&nbsp; If you can’t identify it, don’t worry.&nbsp; Work on relaxing and calming yourself.</p>

        <div class="field-item even"><p>Finding people who can help you cope with anxious feelings can be very beneficial.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Families and friends:</strong> Talking to family and friends about anxiety can be scary and anxiety-producing in and of itself, but family and friends can be a great source of support.&nbsp; They can be comforting because they know you and can help you cope with difficult times.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Support groups:</strong> Support groups give you a chance to connect with other people who have similar experiences.&nbsp; Formal support groups for anxiety conditions and groups for other factors contributing to anxiety such as single parenting, grief, and nightmares can also be very helpful.&nbsp; If you're a veteran you can find more information on these groups&nbsp;at your local VA center.

        <h3>Things That Can Lead to Depression</h3>

          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Depression's Downward Spiral</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Negative thoughts often lead to depressed feelings. Depressed feelings make people less likely to engage in behavior that might make them feel better (see Figure 1). This can lead to more negative thoughts, which in turn can lead to even fewer positive activities.</p>
          <p><br>Consider Bob. When Bob feels depressed, he is less likely to do things that will help him feel better. This is known as the downward spiral of depression. The less Bob does, the more depressed he gets.</p>
          
          <p>Depression may keep people from doing things they enjoyed in the past. If physical injuries make it more difficult to do those things, it’s important to find other pleasurable activities. Not enjoying things in life can make depression worse.</p>

        <p>Your behaviors can have effects on your moods. In this chapter you will learn about how negative or positive actions lead to negative or positive moods. 
        You’ll also learn techniques for stopping the downward spiral of depression including the importance of moving toward goals in a practical way.</p>
        <h3>Negative Action, Negative Mood</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Depression usually makes people feel down, tired, sad, and hopeless. A depressed person might:</p>
          <ul><li>Avoid tasks that require energy or effort</li>
            <li>Put off important tasks until they feel better</li>
            <li>Avoid family or friends</li>
            <li>Sleep a lot or have trouble sleeping</li>
            <li>Misuse alcohol and other substances</li>
            <li>Overeat, or not eat well</li>
            <li>Watch TV or play video games alone</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Find Your Depression TRAPs</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p><strong>The Depression TRAP</strong>:<br><strong>T</strong> = Trigger<br><strong>R</strong> = Response<br><strong>A P</strong> = Avoidance Pattern</p>
        </div>
        <div class="field-item even"><p>To get out of the downward spiral of depression, figure out what behavior is making the depression worse. We call these behaviors “depression TRAPs.” TRAP stands for:</p>
          <p><strong>T</strong>rigger: a situation or thought that triggers depression feelings</p>
          <p><strong>R</strong>esponse: a feeling accompanying depression, aften irritation or tiredness</p>
          <p><strong>A</strong>voidance <strong>P</strong>attern: a behavior intended to avoid the triggering situation, and by avoiding, often leads to more depression</p>
          <p>Here’s an example:</p>
          <ul><li>T = John’s friends ask him to watch a football game with them. John thinks to himself, “I’m tired and sad. It’s pointless to watch the game. I won’t have fun anyway.”</li>
          <li>R = John feels irritated, tired, and more depressed.</li>
          <li>A P = John decides to stay home and doesn’t go out with his friends.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It can be hard to figure out what’s prolonging your depression or making it worse. Avoidance behaviors are often the cause. Avoidance means putting off doing things you could do, or not doing things that will help you feel better.</p>
          <p><br>An example of doing something that can make depression worse: Taking a nap in the middle of the day because you feel tired or feel you don't have the energy to do something you might normally like to do. Taking a nap can interrupt your usual nighttime sleep pattern, causing you to feel less rested the next day.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Positive Action, Positive Mood</h3>
        <div class="field-item even"><p>When you know what behaviors are not helpful, you can pull yourself out of the negative spiral. The key to finding your way out of depression is to move toward what’s important. Do things in line with your goals and values, even if you don’t feel motivated at first. Taking small steps toward your goals can lift your depression.</p>
          <p>Think about your goals:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Where would you like to be and what would you like to be doing in one month, one year, or 5 years?</li>
            <li>When you know where you want to be, think about small, simple steps you can take to reach these goals</li>
            <li>Start taking those small steps toward your goals</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Remember, feelings can influence your decisions, but feelings can’t cause behavior. Here’s an example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Instead of going out with friends, John chooses to stay home. Walking into his kitchen, John notices his sink is full of dirty dishes. He thinks about washing the dishes, and then realizes he feels depressed. He decides to take a nap, thinking, “I’ll wash the dishes later, when I feel better.”</li>
            <li>John’s feelings <strong>influenced</strong> his choice to take a nap, but those feelings <strong>didn’t cause</strong> him to take a nap. John made that choice.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Here’s another example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>As John heads to his bedroom to take a nap, his roommate says, “Hey John, I have a date coming over tonight. I’ll pay you $20 to wash the dishes before she gets here.” John still feels depressed, but he decides to wash the dishes because he needs the extra money.</li>
            <li>John’s depression was making him feel like taking a nap, but John still chose to wash the dishes. His feelings didn’t cause his actions.<span id="cke_bm_159E" style="DISPLAY: none"> </span></li>
          </ul>
          <p>What causes and controls behaviors? <strong>Thoughts </strong>affect feelings and actions. A person may <strong>think </strong>it’s a good idea to work toward life values and goals, even when feeling depressed, tired and lacking motivation.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Depression Tips: Moving Towards Goals</h3>
        <div class="field-item even"><p>Here are some realistic ways to work toward your goals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Set <strong>realistic </strong>and achievable goals</li>
          <li>Break big goals into smaller ones and <strong>prioritize</strong> them as tasks</li>
          <li>Make a<strong> To Do list</strong> for your tasks</li>
          <li>Go at a <strong>realistic</strong> pace</li>
          <li>Set a <strong>routine</strong>, so you can begin to form new habits</li>
          <li><strong>Go easy</strong> on yourself. Don’t worry about doing things perfectly</li>

        <h3>The Role of Thoughts in Depression</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Automatic thoughts occur without you realizing it. Automatic thoughts reflect what’s happening around you or how you feel about yourself. Negative automatic thoughts can contribute to depression.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, you can change negative automatic thoughts. Your thinking is learned, just like your skills or habits are learned. Much of what you think and believe comes from what you’ve learned from others.&nbsp; Your thoughts can be influenced by parents, friends, the media, and society.</p>
          <p>Some forms of depression are known as learned thinking problems. You can control your negative thoughts by learning how to think positively.</p>
          <p>People tend to blame others or events for their negative feelings.&nbsp; For example, you might say, “My roommate makes me mad.” But really, what you mean is "My roommate does things that I don't like and I get mad at that." People and events don’t cause thoughts and feelings.&nbsp; Feelings and behaviors are influenced by your thoughts, your belief systems, and how you interpret situations.</p>
          <p>Depressed people often think they’re worthless, helpless, and hopeless.&nbsp; The feelings tied to these thoughts can be so strong and real that a depressed person won’t question or challenge them.&nbsp; The more you dwell on negative thoughts, the more real they seem.&nbsp; But these negative thoughts are part of the depression and aren’t necessarily true.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Role of Negative Thoughts in Depression</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Negative thoughts often center on three ideas:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>&nbsp;I am the cause of ______ (bad event).&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, “I failed the training because I’m not good enough.”</li>
            <li>One bad thing means everything is bad. For example, “My girlfriend broke up with me so my life whole is screwed up.”</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Ten Common Thinking Errors</h3>
        <div class="field-item even"><p>Some negative automatic thoughts distort the truth, making things seem worse than they really are. These are called thinking errors. When your thoughts don’t fit all the facts, you have a thinking error. Here are ten types of thinking errors.</p>
          <ol style="margin-left: 40px;"><li><strong>All-or-Nothing Thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br>Thinking in terms of&nbsp; either/or, black and white, good or bad, right or wrong.<br><strong>SOLUTION: &nbsp;</strong>Look for the middle ground or “gray” area</li>
            <li><strong>Exaggerating or Minimizing.&nbsp; </strong><br>When you exaggerate, you make too big a deal out of a negative experience, or you think things are more negative than they really are. When you minimize, you don’t give yourself or others enough credit for doing something good.<br><strong>SOLUTION: </strong>Stop blowing things out or proportion and recognize success.</li>
            <li><strong>Overgeneralization. </strong><br>Thinking that if something bad happened once or twice it will always happen.<br><strong>SOLUTION: </strong>Remember that because something happened once or twice does not mean it will always happen again in the future.</li>
            <li><strong>Mental Filter. </strong><br>Seeing only the bad side of things.<br><strong>SOLUTION: &nbsp;</strong>Notice positive things. Realize that they count as much or more than negative things</li>
            <li><strong>Not Accepting the Positive.&nbsp; </strong><br>Rejecting anything positive, especially positive information about yourself.<br><strong>SOLUTION: </strong>Accept the positive parts of life and yourself. Appreciate compliments from others. Ask yourself, “<em>Why is it so easy to believe negative comments and reject positive compliments?&nbsp; Is that fair?”</em></li>
            <li><strong>Reasoning with Feelings Instead of Logic or Facts. </strong><br>Example:&nbsp; “I feel like a loser, so I must be a loser.”<br><strong>SOLUTION: </strong>Question the feelings you use to make conclusions or decisions. If they’re not based on logic or fact, ignore those feelings.</li>
            <li><strong>Jumping to Conclusions </strong><br>When you think you know what will happen without getting the facts first. Or when you think you know what someone else is thinking.<br><strong>SOLUTION: &nbsp;</strong>Check all the facts before deciding.&nbsp; Remember, you don’t know the future, and you don’t know how to read minds.</li>
            <li><strong>Labeling </strong><br>Judging others (or yourself) without enough information. You may also judge your past mistakes too harshly. This has the effect of making it harder to accept mistakes. And, once the labels get “attached,” they become difficult to remove.<br><strong>SOLUTION: &nbsp;</strong>Accept people’s shortcomings (including your own) and move on.</li>
            <li><strong>“Should” Statements </strong><br>Statements based on rules or standards you set for yourself and others. These standards are often unrealistic and cause negative thoughts and feelings.<br><strong>SOLUTION: &nbsp;</strong>Stop beating people up with “should” statements.&nbsp; Remember, life doesn’t always happen the way you plan or expect.</li>
            <li><strong>Taking it Personally </strong><br>Assuming people do negative things on purpose. People who take things too personally may blame themselves for things they shouldn’t.<br><strong>SOLUTION: &nbsp;</strong>A more healthy way to think is to look at the facts; most likely others did not do negative things on purpose. Also, take a look at the facts to see if you are really responsible for a negative situation.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <h3>Challenging Negative Thinking</h3>
        <div class="field-item even"><p>To stop these disrupting thoughts, challenge them.&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Think about the cause of your negative thoughts and feelings.</li>
            <li>Play “devil's advocate” with your negative thoughts. Look at the facts and challenge those thoughts.</li>
            <li>Check to see if you're making one of the 10 thinking errors; if you are try to correct it!</li>

        <h3>What Is Grief?</h3>
        <div class="field-item even"><p>Grief is a reaction to loss and a necessary part of healing after a loss.&nbsp; People usually grieve when a loved one dies, but you can feel grief after any kind of loss.</p>
          <p>People are often surprised by their reactions to grief.&nbsp; For example, a person may feel shock when they first learn that a loved one has died.&nbsp; They may get angry at God, themselves, the person who died, or someone they think is responsible.&nbsp; They may also feel guilty about not having done something differently before the person died.</p>
          
          <p>Death and loss can cause significant changes in life.&nbsp; Parenting alone, adjusting to single life after divorce, or going back to work are all significant life changes.&nbsp; These changes may add stress, so it’s important to have the support of others.&nbsp; You can get support from family members, friends, a chaplain or other spiritual advisor, or a health care professional or psychiatrist.</p>
          
          <div class="field-item even"><p><strong>LOSS CAN INCLUDE:</strong></p>

        <h3>How Long Does Grief Last?</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Grief’s timeline is different for everyone. It can take many months for the painful feelings and thoughts to go away. But, over time, grief <strong>will</strong> decrease. As you grieve, you’ll have good days and bad days.</p>
          <p>It’s common for grief to return “out of the blue” –that’s part of the grieving process. Important dates, like anniversaries or birthdays, can bring back intense feelings of grief.</p>
          <p>Grieving often involves talking about your loss with other people.&nbsp; However, sometimes people have a hard time grieving because:</p>
          <ul style="margin-left: 280px;">
            <li>They’re uncomfortable</li>
            <li>They were raised to believe that they should never be sad or cry</li>
            <li>They believe upsetting feelings are a sign of weakness, or grieving is only okay at funerals</li>
            <li>Their friends or family tell them, “Stay strong and move on with your life.”</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Coping with Grief</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Not dealing with your grief can lead to depression.&nbsp; Coping with loss and grief in healthy ways can keep things from getting worse.&nbsp; Here are some things that can help the grieving process happen naturally, which will help avoid depression:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Give yourself permission to grieve. <em>Grief is normal and natural</em></li>
            <li>Remember that your grieving process will take time. Be patient</li>
            <li>Spend time with people who have suffered a similar loss. Join a support group and share your story with others</li>
            <li>Find helpful people, such as family or friends, or a chaplain or other spiritual<br>advisor</li>
            <li>If the grief doesn’t go away, seek professional help from a psychologist, social worker, or other health care professional</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Warning Signs Grief Is Severe</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Several warning signs may suggest a person has a severe grief reaction and needs help. We strongly recommend contacting a healthcare professional immediately if ANY of the following warning signs are present:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Thoughts or plans to commit suicide or self-harm</li>
            <li>Grief getting in the way of self-care, like eating or personal hygiene</li>
            <li>Distractions to avoid grieving:<br><ul style="list-style-type:circle;"><li>Refusal to talk about the loss</li>
            <li>Denial of thoughts and feelings about the loss</li>
            <li>Refusal to talk or think about memories related to the loss</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Inability to function for weeks to months after the loss</li>
            <li>Inability to perform work, school, of family responsibilities</li>

      title : '6. Getting Support for Depression',
      content : `
        <p>Even though it is hard to ask for help, there are many resources available to help yourself or someone you know with depression and other behavioral health concerns. 
        This section explains when to seek professional help and addresses stigma myths.</p>
        <h3>When Stigma Gets in the Way</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>People are often skeptical of getting help or treatment.&nbsp; There may be stigma or shame attached to getting help, 
          especially within the military.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>These thoughts prevent people from getting the help they need.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Service members are often hesitant to seek help for depression because of the following thoughts.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>“Getting help will affect my career.”</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Service members are more likely to get in trouble if they <em>don’t</em> seek help.&nbsp; Avoiding treatment for depression can result in negative behavior toward co-workers and poor work performance.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>“My leaders have access to my behavioral health records.”</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">While a commanding officer may request a Service member’s medical records, providers usually keep all records confidential.&nbsp; If you have concerns about the privacy of your records, ask your chaplain or provider.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>“My service records will show my behavioral health information.”</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Military service records don’t contain behavioral health information unless the Service member was ordered to get help or found unfit for duty.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>“My command discourages me from getting help.”</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Local community resources are available to Service members uncomfortable with finding help through the military.&nbsp; Service members and their units will benefit 
          if they seek and receive help for their problems.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Where to Get Help for Depression</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Even though it’s hard to ask for help, healthcare professionals offer a safe place to talk about depression.&nbsp; If you need help, here are some resources to consider:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>An installation's support services can provide information and support. &nbsp;</strong>Support services include a chaplain, a military treatment facility, family advocacy programs and family centers.&nbsp; Phone numbers are listed in the installation’s directory.</li>
            <li><strong>Talk to command</strong>.&nbsp; Check in with a leader about how to handle a stressful situation before it gets out of control.&nbsp; Keeping leadership informed is good practice.</li>
            <li><strong>Make an appointment at your local medical facility. &nbsp;</strong>Ask your health care provider about available treatment options and a referral to a behavioral health practitioner, if needed.</li>

          <p>Anger is an emotion that ranges from slight irritation to intense rage. Uncontrolled anger can lead to problems in daily living causing strains on the body and on your relationships.</p>
          <p>People get angry when they feel threatened, wronged, or powerless.&nbsp; Some people act impulsively, aggressively, or violently when they are angry.&nbsp; But you can choose to express your anger in a healthy way.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>When Does Anger Become a Problem?</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
        <p>Anger creates problems in civilian life when it’s too intense, happens too often, or leads to violent behavior.&nbsp; Intense and frequent anger strains the body, causing these health problems:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>High blood pressure</li>
            <li>Headaches</li>
            <li>Chronic pain</li>
            <li>Heart disease</li>
            <li>Muscle and joint pain</li>
            <li>Dental problems (from jaw clenching and teeth grinding)</li>
            <li>High cholesterol</li>
            <li>Weak immune system</li>
            <li>Stomach and digestive system problems</li>
            <li>Early death</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Aggressive behavior can also cause problems in relationships and at work, producing feelings of shame, guilt, and regret.&nbsp; Left unchecked, anger which has turned into aggression often leads to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Frequent arguments</li>
            <li>Strained relationships and divorce</li>
            <li>Injury to self or others</li>
            <li>Domestic violence</li>
            <li>Child and pet abuse</li>
            <li>Work-related problems</li>
            <li>Legal and money problems</li>
            <li>Road rage and traffic tickets</li>

        <p>People confuse anger with aggression. Anger is an emotion.  Aggression is a behavior.  Someone can feel angry without behaving aggressively. Aggressive behavior includes things like verbal threats or 
        physical violence. Aggressive behavior tells people, “My feelings, thoughts, and beliefs are more important than yours.”  This often hurts relationships with family, friends, and co-workers. 
        Anger may turn into aggressive behavior unless you find healthy ways to deal with it.</p>
        <h3>Anger Management: Assertiveness</h3>
        <div class="field-item even"><p>Assertiveness is also a type of behavior.&nbsp; But assertive people work through their anger without getting aggressive.&nbsp; Assertive behavior says “My feelings, thoughts, and beliefs are important. But your feelings, thoughts, and beliefs are equally important.”</p>
          <p>Assertiveness doesn’t mean ignoring your own rights and feelings – that’s called passive behavior.&nbsp; Assertiveness means standing up for your rights, while respecting the rights of others. Here's how an assertive response to anger differs from an aggressive response:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>ANGER: Josie is upset that Karen borrowed her car and dented the bumper.</em></li>
            <li><em>AGGRESSION: Josie screams at Karen.</em></li>
            <li><em>ASSERTIVENESS: Josie tells Karen that she’s upset but acknowledges the dent was an accident.</em></li>
          </ul>
          <p>An assertive response often can lead to a positive outcome, like this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>The two friends work out a plan to fix Karen's car.</em></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Pros and Cons of Aggression</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Aggressive behavior may have temporary pay-offs, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Quickly-met demands, thanks to people’s fear of verbal or physical threats.</li>
            <li>A feeling of respect from others when they give in to aggressive demands.</li>
            <li>The release of built-up physical or emotional tension.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><br>But the long-term costs of aggression outweigh any short-term benefits.&nbsp; Strained or ruined relationships, property destruction, and legal trouble are all results of long-term aggression.</p>
          <p><strong>Example: </strong>A father regularly threatens his children to get them to obey.&nbsp; But over time the children begin to fear and dislike their father.&nbsp; The kids also begin to believe threatening behavior is appropriate.&nbsp; The father’s short-term gain, obedient children, is nothing compared to the long-term negative impact of his behavior.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>The Anger Meter</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>The Anger Meter makes you more aware of your anger.&nbsp; Crowds, noisy children, strangers acting rudely, or stress can all trigger anger.&nbsp; The Anger Meter pinpoints how these triggers affect anger levels.&nbsp; The Meter features a 0 to 10 scale.&nbsp; A "0" on the scale means calm.&nbsp; A “10” on the scale means rage and aggressive behavior. A "10" on the scale is reserved for aggressive behavior that causes harm.</p>
          <p>People don’t score a "9" or "10" right away.&nbsp; Anger usually starts low and moves up the scale.&nbsp; Some people who hold in their anger may hold steady at a "3" or "4" for a long time, then suddenly spike to a "10."</p>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> Ed is at a party when someone spills his drink.&nbsp; The person apologizes, but Ed starts yelling and cursing.&nbsp; When Ed tries to pick a fight with the other partygoer, Ed’s friends have to restrain him.&nbsp; Ed has reached a "10" on the Anger Meter scale.&nbsp; Ed’s aggressive behavior led to strained relationships and the threat of legal problems.</p>
          <p><br>Everyone’s Anger Meter scores are different.&nbsp; In other words, a "5" for one person may be a "7" for someone else.&nbsp; For most people, a score above "3" suggests they’re less able to think clearly.&nbsp; If your anger level rises above "3," use an anger management tool to lower your anger.</p>
          <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Carry a copy of the Anger Meter with you so you can monitor your anger level when stressed.&nbsp; Be consistent when scoring how angry you feel.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>The Aggression Cycle</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>The Three Stages of the Aggression Cycle:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The Escalation Phase: During the escalation phase, anger is building. Scores below "10" on the Anger Meter mean you’re in the escalation phase.&nbsp; Even if your anger level is a "9," it’s possible to get your anger under control. If not, you’ll wind up in the explosion phase.</li>
            <li>The Explosion Phase: In the explosion phase, you express anger with verbal or physical aggression.&nbsp; This may include cursing, breaking or hitting things, or fighting.&nbsp; Releasing anger explosively usually leads to negative results.&nbsp; The explosion phase scores a "10" on the Anger Meter.</li>
            <li>The Post-Explosion Phase: The post-explosion phase is the result of the explosion phase.&nbsp; Post-explosion results include hurt partners or friends, struggles at work, legal problems, and feelings of guilt, shame, or regret.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Managing your anger means avoiding the explosion phase.&nbsp; You can manage your anger by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Increasing your awareness of your anger triggers.</li>
            <li>Watching for cues, or warning signs, that your anger is building.</li>
            <li>Using the Anger Meter to monitor your anger levels.</li>
            <li>Being assertive instead of aggressive.</li>
            <li>Learning how to stop or reverse anger escalation.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>What Triggers Anger?</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>The way you interpret an event determines your emotional response.</p>
          <p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Steve and Bill are two drivers unable to pass a slower car.&nbsp; While Steve wants to get home after a long workday, he realizes he can’t pass the slower car without creating a safety hazard.&nbsp; Steve chooses to relax by listening to his favorite talk show on his car radio. </em><em>Meanwhile, Bill gets impatient with the slower car. He assumes the slower driver lacks good driving skills. Bill tries to get the driver’s attention by honking his horn, flashing his headlights, and screaming out his window.&nbsp; When the slower car doesn't respond, Bill screams even louder.</em></p>
          <p>Steve and Bill interpreted the same event differently.&nbsp; Different interpretations led to different behaviors.&nbsp; Steve calmed down while enjoying a radio program.&nbsp; Bill’s anger just got worse.</p>
          <p>Painful or angry memories can trigger anger.</p>
          <p><strong>Example</strong>:&nbsp; While sitting in a coffee shop, Beth sees someone who looks like a close friend seriously wounded in Iraq.&nbsp; Beth thinks back to the anger she felt seeing her friend in a hospital bed, and realizes she feels angry.</p>
          <p>Here are some examples of some anger triggers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Long waits to see a doctor</li>
            <li>Traffic jams</li>
            <li>Persistent belief that your family or friends don’t support you</li>
            <li>Crowded places</li>
            <li>Insensitive jokes made by others</li>
            <li>Friends NOT repaying money they owe you</li>
            <li>False accusations against you</li>
            <li>Messy room or house left by your partner, kids, or friends</li>
            <li>Neighbors playing the stereo too loud</li>
            <li>Long waits for customer service while on the telephone</li>
            <li>Rumors that are untrue or hurtful</li>
            <li>Personal property that gets stolen or misplaced</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Anger Cues</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Once you recognize your anger triggers, try to identify your response "cues" to them. These cues signal that your anger level is rising. Cues include physical sensations, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Physical Cues:</strong> The way your body responds when you’re angry, such as a pounding or racing heart, chest tightness, upset stomach, or feeling hot or flushed</li>
            <li><strong>Behavioral Cues:</strong> Actions you take when you’re angry, such as yelling, teeth-clenching, fist-clenching, door-slamming, or loud complaining</li>
            <li><strong>Feeling Cues:</strong> Feelings you have when you’re angry, such as embarrassment, powerlessness, frustration, hurt, or fear.&nbsp; You may have underlying feelings that make your anger more intense</li>
            <li><strong>Thought Cues:</strong> Thoughts or interpretations that affect your reaction to an event.&nbsp; If you think something is wrong or unfair, you will likely feel angry.&nbsp; Revenge fantasies are also thought cues and a sign of growing anger</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Self-Talk and Anger</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Your thoughts are sometimes called “self-talk.”&nbsp; It’s normal to talk to yourself about your circumstances or situation. Most of us engage in self-talk without knowing it. Self-talk can be positive or negative.</p>
          <p><strong>Should statements</strong> include words like "should," "shouldn’t", "must", "ought", "always", or "need to". You may have strong beliefs about the way things "should" be, or how people "should" act.&nbsp; These beliefs aren’t always realistic or helpful.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:36.0pt;"><strong>Example:</strong> <em>Danny gets home after a tough workday to find the house a mess, the baby crying, and dinner unmade.&nbsp; Danny believes he "should" expect a clean, quiet home and dinner waiting.&nbsp; So he yells at his wife.</em></p>
          <p>Some things can’t be controlled, like people and certain situations.&nbsp; Getting angry and acting out won’t help.&nbsp; Exploding in anger just makes things worse.&nbsp; Instead, work to change those things you can control.&nbsp; Rather than getting angry, Danny could make dinner or help with the baby.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>When challenging negative self-talk that includes "should" statements, remember these things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You have the right to want things, but others have a right to say “no”</li>
            <li>You must accept some things in life “as is”</li>
            <li>Everyone has needs and priorities, and others may not act the way you expect</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Blame</strong> is the belief that someone else caused physical or emotional pain on purpose.&nbsp; People who blame others often assume the worst about situations.&nbsp; They act like they can read other people’s<br>minds.&nbsp; They get angry without giving the other person the benefit of the doubt.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:36.0pt;"><strong>Example:</strong> <em>“My leader didn’t give me the assignment I wanted because he’s trying to sabotage my<br>promotion.”</em></p>
          <p>To challenge blaming thoughts, remember:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Jumping to conclusions and assuming the worst is not helpful.</li>
            <li>Reading minds is not possible.</li>
            <li>Blaming others doesn’t solve problems.&nbsp; It just creates more stress for everyone.</li>
            <li>Problems are often smaller than they first appear.</li>
            <li>Normally, people don't try to hurt others on purpose.</li>

          <p>As your anger builds, you may find it hard to remember these tools.&nbsp; So keep copies of your Anger Control Plan at home, at work, in the car, and in your wallet or purse.&nbsp; Whenever you start to feel angry, refer to your Anger Control Plan.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Helpful Coaches</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>The first tool in the Anger Control Plan is a helpful coach–someone you trust with your anger problems.&nbsp; Tell your coach about the thoughts and feelings you had when you were angry.&nbsp; 
          Helpful coaches act as a "third party" when people talk about their anger triggers.&nbsp; Your helpful coach can give you a different point of view on the event that made you angry.&nbsp; 
          You can choose just about anyone to be a helpful coach:&nbsp; a supportive friend, family member, supervisor, teacher, or counselor.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Anger Time-Outs</h3>
        <div class="field-item even"><p>Take a time-out as soon as your anger level begins to rise.&nbsp; Time-outs allow you to cool down as you leave a situation or stop a discussion triggering your anger. Time-outs give you time to consider all your options before responding.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:18.0pt;"><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li style="margin-left: 18pt;"><em>George is riding on a crowded bus.&nbsp; He is constantly bumped and jostled by other passengers. George realizes he’s getting angry and decides to use a time-out.&nbsp; He exits the bus at the next stop and walks the rest of the way home.</em></li>
            <li style="margin-left: 18pt;"><em>Susan and Denise have a heated discussion at dinner.&nbsp; Susan recommends a time out, and then walks to the kitchen for a glass of water.&nbsp; After Susan calms down, she returns to her conversation with Denise.</em></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Time-outs are ideal in the “heat of the moment.”&nbsp; Though Susan’s anger rose quickly on the Anger Meter, the time-out allowed her to walk away before she reached a "10."&nbsp; Time-outs also work well when combined with other anger management tools.&nbsp; George combined his time-out with exercise by exiting the bus and walking home.</p>
          <p><strong>Should I Tell Others About My Time-Out?</strong></p>
          <p>Yes.&nbsp; Time-outs work best when you set some ground rules with others before you get angry.&nbsp; Discuss your time-out ground rules when everyone is calm and there’s time to discuss the details. Once everyone knows the ground rules, anyone involved in a situation may use a time-out.&nbsp; The person calling the time-out may leave the situation, if they agree to finish the discussion or resolve the argument later.</p>
          <p><strong>Can I ever Use a Time-Out without Setting the Ground Rules First?</strong></p>
          <p>Yes.&nbsp; For example, you may need to use a time-out in a public place, such as a store, bank, bar, or restaurant.&nbsp; If you get angry with a stranger, you can use a time-out without talking through the ground rules first.</p>
          <p><strong>Reminder:</strong>&nbsp; Some time-outs may be inappropriate. For example, taking a time-out when a leader is giving orders might appear disrespectful.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>How to take a time out</h4>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p><strong>Follow these steps to take a time-out:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>When you realize you’re getting angry during an argument, say out loud, “I’m beginning to feel really angry, and I need to take a time-out.”</li>
            <li>Tell the other person your time-out may last about an hour. If possible, leave the situation.</li>
            <li>When the time-out ends, see if the other person is ready to continue the discussion.&nbsp; Don’t force them. Some topics may require you to postpone things until you find a “referee.”&nbsp; Your first priority is to avoid violence and other aggressive behavior.</li>
            <li>When you start the conversation up again, check your anger level.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>During your time-out:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Do not use alcohol or drugs</li>
            <li>Do not drive</li>
            <li>Do something healthy to reduce anger (go for a walk or talk with a helpful coach)</li>
            <li>Use your relaxation skills</li>
            <li>Take a "mental time-out" to block any thoughts that might fuel your anger</li>
            <li>Do something with your hands, like cleaning, working in the garage, or gardening</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Time-outs can be tough when people believe their self-respect is on the line. You may want to stay, resolve the situation, or have the last word in the argument.&nbsp; You may think things will never be resolved if you walk away.&nbsp; Unlearning destructive behavior patterns gets easier with time and practice.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Conflict Resolution Model</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>The Conflict Resolution Model is a way to act assertively.</p>
          <p><strong>Conflict Resolution involves five steps:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Identify the problem triggering the conflict. Be specific.&nbsp; In our example, Joe’s lateness creates conflict for Betty.</li>
            <li>Identify the feelings associated with the conflict.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Identify the impact of the problem.</li>
            <li>Choose whether or not to “let it go.”</li>
            <li>If you choose not to let it go, then address and resolve the conflict.<br type="_moz"><br>&nbsp;</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>Betty carpools with Joe.&nbsp; Lately, Joe hasn’t been ready on time, making Betty late for work.&nbsp; After getting in trouble for being late, Betty is angry at Joe.</em></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1 Identify the trigger:</strong> When Joe causes her to be late Betty feels annoyed and frustrated.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2 Identify the feelings:</strong> Betty feels annoyed and frustrated.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3 Identify the impact: </strong>Joe's lateness causes Bett to be late for work.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4 Choose to “let it go":</strong> Ask yourself, “Is this conflict important enough to bring up?”&nbsp; Betty should ask herself, “If I don’t resolve this issue with Joe, will I continue to get angry?”</li>
            <li><strong>Or Step 5 Choose to address and resolve the conflict</strong>: Agree on a time and place to discuss the conflict and find a solution.&nbsp; Betty could say to Joe, “You’ve been late the last few times I’ve come to pick you up.&nbsp; I’m starting to get frustrated and feel like I’m being taken for granted.&nbsp; When you run late, it makes me run late, too. Please be on time in the future.”</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Relaxation Techniques</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Anger’s physical cues include increased heart rate, feeling hot or flushed, and muscle tension. These physical cues are known as stress response.&nbsp; With stress response, the nervous system is aroused or “pumped up.”&nbsp; When a person feels “pumped up,” their anger level can rise quickly.</p>
          <p>But the nervous system also has a relaxation response to help deal with stress.<br type="_moz"><br>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Deep Breathing</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Slowly breathe in for a count of three, while expanding your belly.</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Slowly breathe out for a count of three.</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Repeat steps 1 and 2 for one minute.&nbsp; If you don’t feel relaxed, repeat until you do.<br type="_moz"><br>&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Progressive Muscle Relaxation</strong></p>
          <p>Muscle relaxation reduces muscle tension.&nbsp; The technique teaches you to feel the difference between a tensed muscle and a relaxed muscle.&nbsp; Over time, relaxing specific muscle groups gets easier, so you can relax your muscles anytime, anywhere.</p>
          <ol>
            <li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Sit or lie in a comfortable position with your feet, hands, arms, and neck supported.</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Take a few deep breaths and think the word “relax”.</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Focus on your legs and feet.&nbsp; Tense your legs by flexing your feet and pointing your toes toward your upper body.&nbsp; You’ll feel tension spread through your feet and legs.</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Hold for a few seconds and then release.&nbsp; Relax your feet and legs completely, while thinking the word “relax”.</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Now focus on your belly.&nbsp; Tense your belly by pulling it in toward your spine.</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Hold for a few seconds then release.&nbsp; Tense your hands and arms by making a tight fist and tensing your forearms, biceps, and triceps.</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Hold for a few seconds and then release.&nbsp; Relax your hands and arms completely, while thinking the word “relax”.</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Continue by tensing the following muscle groups. Hold the tension in each muscle group for a few seconds and then release the tension and think the word “relax”:</li>
          </ol>
          <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li>Your shoulders</li>
            <li>Your jaw</li>
            <li>The muscles around your eyes</li>

          <h5><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Basic Sleep Facts</strong></span></h5>
          <p>Sleep helps people cope with stress, solve problems, and recover from illness or injury. Lack of sleep can lead to drowsiness, irritability, lack of concentration, and memory and physical problems.</p>
          <h5><strong><span style="font-size: 12px;">The Stages Of Sleep</span></strong></h5>
          <p>Sleep is a complex activity and occurs in five stages. In the first stage, the body and brain enter a relaxed state of wakefulness. People slowly enter a deeper and more restful sleep in the second, third, and fourth stages. It is during the fifth stage, the Rapid Eye Movement or REM stage, that dreaming occurs. While people often awaken temporarily as they shift from one sleep stage to the next, most fall right back to sleep.</p>
          <h5><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Sleep Rhythms</strong></span></h5>
          <p>Our bodies naturally want to be awake during the day and to sleep at night—this natural tendency is referred to as the <strong>circadian</strong> <strong>rhythm</strong>. Your circadian rhythm is hard to change, and explains why adjusting to a late-night work or duty schedule can be difficult.</p>
          <p>Body temperature also follows a natural cycle, changing throughout the day and night. Your temperature is higher when you’re alert and active, and is lower as you become less active and tired.</p>
          <h5><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Getting Enough Sleep</strong></span></h5>
          <p>While the amount of sleep needed for good health and optimum performance mostly depends on the individual, experts suggest that adults function best when they get seven to nine hours of sleep each night. You should figure out how much sleep you need to feel well-rested. Ensuring that fatigue isn’t a problem during the day is one way of determining how much sleep is needed.</p>
          <h3>Sleep Problems</h3>
          <p>It’s normal to lose sleep over stressful life events. In this section you will learn about different sleep problems and coping techniques.</p>
          <h5><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Common Sleeping Problems</strong></span></h5>
          <p>From time to time, most people encounter occasions during which they are not getting enough sleep. Sleep problems can be caused by stress, pain, drugs, alcohol, diet, lack of exercise, or an irregular sleep schedule. People who are not sleeping well are more likely to be depressed, irritable, or anxious.</p>
          <p>Poor sleep problems can be associated with attention, concentration, and memory. Chronic sleep problems can contribute to increased risk of accidents, relationship problems, and job performance issues.<br>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>WARNING SIGNS: SLEEP PROBLEMS</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Having a hard time falling asleep or staying asleep.</li>
            <li>Having a hard time staying awake during the day.</li>
            <li>Feeling tired even after sleeping a lot.<br>&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You may have a hard time <strong>falling asleep </strong>if you feel:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>“On-edge” </strong>or on-alert. Deployed service members especially must often stay awake to protect their units. You may find it difficult to switch back to a normal sleep pattern after being on alert.</li>
            <li>Discomfort from <strong>medical conditions, </strong>like chronic pain after an injury.</li>
            <li>Unable to shut off <strong>your thoughts</strong>. Your mind may keep replaying something bad that happened. Maybe you can’t stop worrying about some situation. Or maybe you concentrate too hard on falling asleep.<br>&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These things can make it hard to <strong>stay asleep</strong>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Drugs or alcohol</li>
            <li>Bad dreams, nightmares, or sleep terrors</li>
            <li>Thrashing around in bed or actively moving arms or legs during nightmares.</li>
            <li>Getting up to check if the house is safe after a noise wakes you up<br>&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The following list shows things often associated with sleep-wake problems:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Personal loss (such as divorce or death of a loved one)</li>
            <li>Grief</li>
            <li>Stress (such as marriage, kids, money, work, or school)</li>

          <p><strong>COMMON SLEEP-WAKE DISORDERS</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Insomnia</li>
            <li>Nightmares</li>
            <li>Sleep Terrors</li>

            <li>Narcolepsy</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>2.1 Insomnia</strong></p>
          <p>Insomnia means you have trouble falling or staying asleep. Someone with insomnia usually has one or more of the following symptoms:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A hard time falling asleep (taking more than 15 minutes to fall asleep).</li>
            <li>Once sleep, difficulty staying asleep.</li>
            <li>Waking up several times through the night.</li>
            <li>Waking up early then having difficulty getting back to sleep.</li>
            <li>Feeling tired or not well rested.</li>
            <li>Difficulty focusing on tasks.</li>
            <li>Feeling anxious, depressed, or irritable</li>
            <li>Performing poorly at work due to fatigue<br>&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Short</strong> <strong>term</strong> <strong>insomnia </strong>may go away after a few weeks, especially if you reduce your daily stress. However, <strong>chronic insomnia </strong>can last months or years.</p>
          <p>Deployed service members often work long shifts or rotate working days and nights. Unfortunately, shift work can cause insomnia. People who work shift hours often get poor sleep or have problems falling and staying asleep. To reduce the effects of shift work:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Follow a routine sleep schedule when you’re not working.</li>
            <li>Limit the amount of light in your bedroom.</li>
            <li>Wear sunglasses when leaving work.</li>
            <li>Relax after work.</li>
            <li>Practice the healthy <strong>Sleep Habits </strong>suggested in this chapter.<br>&nbsp;</li>
          </ul><p><strong>Insomnia, Anxiety, and Depression</strong></p>
          <p>Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress. Anxiety can help you stay alert and cautious when preparing for a mission or test. Typically, anxiety goes away when your stress goes away. Anxiety that doesn't go away can lead to sleep problems.<br>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Depression can also lead to sleep problems. People with depression often sleep lightly, getting more REM sleep than usual. Even changes in body temperature are different in people with depression.<br>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>To cope with anxiety and depression:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Talk to a <strong>health care </strong>or <strong>behavioral health </strong>professional</li>
            <li>Practice <strong>relaxation</strong> <strong>techniques,</strong> such as deep breathing and muscle relaxation</li>
            <li>Use <strong>visualization </strong>to relax and prepare for sleep. Visualization means imagining yourself in a favorite, peaceful place</li>
            <li>Practice the <strong>thought reframing </strong>technique discussed in this chapter.<br>&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Treating anxiety and depression often helps with sleep problems. In turn, sleeping better helps improve mood problems.</p>
          <p><strong>2.2 Nightmares and Sleep Terrors</strong></p>
          <p>Nightmares and sleep terrors are not the same thing. Occasional nightmares and/or sleep terrors are normal. Usually, nightmares tend to be about stressful or traumatic events. Service members often find they have more nightmares after a stressful or traumatic deployment. Traumatic means exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence. These types of reactions are often associated with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.<br>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><br>During a nightmare, the traumatic event is relived. The same fear, rage, or helplessness that was felt during the actual event may be re-experienced.<br>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Most people don’t remember sleep terrors when they wake up. Any sleep terror memories are single images – not a story like in a nightmare. Sleep terrors can be so frightening or terrifying that you may scream, shake, sweat, feel your heart race, feel confused, or have trouble calming down. When the sleep terror ends, you calm down and return to normal sleep.<br>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>During nightmares and sleep terrors you may violently thrash your arms and legs, this might wake&nbsp;you. You may even act out the violent parts of a nightmare: kicking, punching, or even choking a bed partner. Some people worry that their nightmares or sleep terrors mean they’re going crazy, but this is not true.<br>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>To cope with nightmares and sleep terrors, some people use alcohol or drugs, or even avoid sleeping. Unfortunately, these coping methods not only worse the problem, they often lead to new problems.<br>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Coping with Nightmares</strong><br><br>Nightmares and sleep terrors are symptoms of stress. If you’re stressed or having nightmares/ sleep terrors, you should seek help from trusted family and friends. Talking about your situation may also decrease the occurrences of your nightmares or sleep terrors.<br>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Don’t expect your nightmares to always make sense; they are usually a mixture of all kinds of images and feelings. Sometimes they can be traced to specific events and sometimes they may seem like they have no obvious relationship to anything that’s happened to you.<br>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Here are a few other ways to deal with nightmares and sleep terrors:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you’re confused after waking from a nightmare or sleep terror, turn on a light and observe your room. Begin naming the things you see around you: “That’s my desk; this is my bed; I am in my room.”</li>
            <li>Sometimes it helps to get out of bed and go to another room to calm down.</li>
            <li>Try to be patient and calm. It may take a while to remember where you are.</li>
            <li>When a nightmare or sleep terror wakes you, tell yourself “It was only a nightmare (or sleep terror). It wasn’t real, the event is not happening again. I'm ok.”</li>
            <li>If possible, write down what happened in your nightmares. This can make the dream less scary and help you calm down faster.</li>
            <li>Some people with nightmares act them out while sleeping. To keep yourself safe, you may want to rearrange your bedroom.</li>
            <li>If you sleep with a partner, move the pillows, sleep in a different position, or sleep elsewhere to avoid hurting your partner while acting out a dream.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you are having nightmares, ask your health care professional to refer you to a specialist.</p>
          <p><strong>2.3 Other Sleep Disorders</strong></p>
          <p>Besides insomnia, the most common sleep disorders are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sleep Apnea</li>
            <li>Restless Legs Syndrome</li>
            <li>Narcolepsy<br>&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea</strong></p>
          <p>Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition in which a person stops breathing for several seconds to minutes. The throat briefly closes, blocking air from the lungs. People with sleep apnea may wake up often during the night to breathe. These interruptions in sleep can leave a person exhausted and irritable the next day. In severe cases, sleep apnea can be deadly.<br>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>You may have obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea, if you:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Snore loudly</li>
            <li>Are overweight</li>
            <li>Have high blood pressure</li>
            <li>Have small airways in your nose, throat, or mouth</li>
            <li>Have a family history of sleep apnea<br>&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you have any of these risk factors:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stay away from alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, since these may keep your throat from staying open and clear.</li>
            <li>Lose weight. Even losing a few pounds can make a difference.</li>
            <li>Sleep on your side rather than on your back. This will help to keep the throat open.<br>&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Restless legs syndrome</strong></p>
          <p>People with Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) have crawling, tingling, or burning sensations in their legs or arms. RLS sensations make it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep. People with RLS may also suffer from Periodic Limb Movement disorder — which causes a jerking movement of the legs and arms. These movements happen roughly every 20-40 seconds, waking the person.<br>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>If you think you have RLS, consult with a health care provider. You can also make some lifestyle changes, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Staying away from alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, and certain medications (check with your doctor)</li>
            <li>Practicing good sleep habits. (Make the bedroom comfortable and go to bed and wake up at a consistent time.)</li>
            <li>Exercising regularly</li>
            <li>Massaging your legs and/or arms before bed</li>
            <li>Using heat or ice packs on your legs and arms<br>&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Narcolepsy</strong></p>
          <p>Narcolepsy is a medical disorder. Individuals with narcolepsy have trouble staying awake or fall asleep suddenly and without warning. The condition can occur while driving, working, eating, and even during dangerous activities. While driving, working, eating, and even during dangerous activities. While some people have specific triggers that bring on the condition, the triggers can be difficult to identify.<br>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>You may be at risk if you have:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A sibling or parent with narcolepsy</li>
            <li>Certain thyroid disorders</li>
            <li>Diabetes</li>
            <li>An autoimmune disorder (a disease that makes the body attack itself)<br>&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There is no cure for narcolepsy but these lifestyle changes can help you control it:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Get a good night’s rest</li>
            <li>Take medications as prescribed. A doctor can prescribe medication to help with narcolepsy</li>
            <li>Take naps when you feel sleepy</li>
            <li>Practice good sleep habits, like the ones taught in this program</li>

          <p><strong>3.1 Negative Thoughts About Sleep</strong></p>
          <p>Example: As Gavin gets ready for bed, he thinks to himself, “I didn’t sleep at all last night.<br>I don't know how I'll get through tomorrow if I don’t get some sleep tonight.”<br>Gavin’s negative thoughts make it harder for him to fall asleep,<br>because he’s focused on his lack of sleep.</p>
          <p><br>Negative thoughts at bedtime can set off a negative cycle that leads to insomnia. Your body reacts to negative thoughts and frustration. Your heart may race, your muscles may tense, and your head may start to ache. Your discomfort makes you worry, which makes you restless. Falling asleep is now even harder and may feel impossible.<br><br>Three things to remember about negative thoughts:</p>
          <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li>They’re unpredictable. They sneak up on you without warning.</li>
            <li>They often distort or twist facts, making things seem worse than they really are.</li>
            <li>They can be unlearned. You can improve sleep by learning healthier ways to think.<br>&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Negative thoughts often center on three ideas:</p>
          <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li>“I am the cause of (some bad event).”</li>
            <li>“I caused all the bad things in my life.”</li>
            <li>“One bad thing means everything is bad.”</li>
            <li>“My girlfriend broke up with me, so all women hate me.”</li>
            <li>“Things will always be bad.”</li>
            <li>For example, “I failed my training, so my future is hopeless.”</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changing Negative Thoughts About Sleep</strong><br><br>Thought reframing gives you greater control by identifying negative sleep thoughts and replacing them with accurate and positive sleep thoughts. There are three steps to thought reframing:</p>
          <ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li>Learn about sleep for more accurate and positive thoughts about sleep.</li>
            <li>Keep a log. List the negative thoughts you have about sleep when you lay down, when you wake up during the night, or after you get up in the morning. Review your list in the morning to see which thoughts are negative and inaccurate. For example, if you wrote, “I never get good sleep,” this is probably not true.</li>
            <li>Replace negative thoughts with more accurate and positive thoughts. List out some accurate thoughts about sleep. For example, tell yourself, "I will have a restful night of sleep" or "I'm working</li>
          </ol>
          <p><br><strong>Remember, there are 2 things you can do help your sleep:</strong></p>
          <ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li>Change negative thoughts</li>
            <li>Practice good sleep habits</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>3.3 Sleep Habits</strong></p>
          <p>There are both harmful and healthy sleep habits. This section will review these habits and address common questions people have about sleep problems.<br><br><strong>Harmful Sleep Habits</strong></p>
          <p>When something throws you off your sleep cycle, it’s natural to want to catch up on sleep as soon as possible. But some short-term methods of catching up on sleep cause long-term problems. Watch out for these harmful sleep habits:</p>
          <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li>Napping for more than thirty minutes or taking several naps during the day.</li>
            <li>Sleeping late into the morning</li>
            <li>Going to bed early the next night</li>
            <li>Staying in bed when you’re not tired or can’t sleep</li>
            <li>Worrying about not sleeping</li>
            <li>Focusing on upsetting things while lying in bed</li>
            <li>Working, eating, reading, or watching TV in bed</li>
            <li>Doing stressful things like working, studying, or paying bills before bed</li>
            <li>Surfing the web, reading e-mail, or playing video games before bed</li>
            <li>Using caffeine or nicotine to stay awake or feel more alert during the day</li>
            <li>Drinking alcohol or drugs before sleeping</li>
            <li>Avoiding daytime exercise because of fatigue</li>
          </ul>
          <p><br><strong>Healthy Sleep Habits</strong></p>
          <p>At night, you should prepare your body and mind for sleep. Doing these things at least one hour before bedtime, will help you relax and avoid harmful sleep habits.</p>
          <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li>Listen to soft music or light reading</li>
            <li>Take a warm bath or shower</li>
            <li>Avoid things that are physically or mentally demanding, like working, studying, playing video games, or watching violent movies or TV shows</li>
            <li>Keep your bedroom peaceful and comfortable</li>
            <li>Dim the lights and keep it quiet; darkness and quiet tell the body it's time to sleep</li>
            <li>Keep a comfortable bedroom temperature–not too cold, not too hot</li>
            <li>Follow the same relaxing sleep ritual every night; your body will learn within a few weeks that your relaxation ritual means it’s time for sleep</li>
          </ul>

      title : '4.0 Common Questions about Sleep Problems',
      content : `
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>The following section answers frequently asked questions related to various sleep problems. You can find some quick answers to your questions. You will also find some useful tips about what will help or hurt your chances of getting a good night’s rest</p>
          <p><strong>4.1 Common Questions About Sleep Problems</strong><br><br><strong>If I can’t fall asleep, shouldn’t I just stay in bed until I do?</strong></p>
          <ul style="margin-left: 240px;">
            <li>It’s not good to stay in bed if you can’t fall or stay asleep. Lying awake in bed teaches the body that the bed is a place to stay awake, rather than a place to sleep.</li>
            <li>If you can’t sleep, don’t stay in bed longer than 15 minutes. Go to another room and do something quiet and relaxing. Return to bed when you feel drowsy.<br>&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Shouldn’t I try to catch up when I’ve lost sleep?</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unfortunately it’s impossible to catch up on lost sleep. Sleeping in late or going to bed early may cause your body to learn a new, harmful sleep pattern. Don’t allow yourself to stay in bed for more than an hour longer than you would get with a normal night's sleep. If you want to overcome sleep problems, set a sleep schedule and stick to it.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><br><strong>What about nicotine?</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Because nicotine is a stimulant, it can actually interfere with sleep. Don't smoke, chew or dip tobacco near bedtime.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><br><strong>Won’t alcohol help me to sleep?</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>It’s best to avoid alcohol at night. While alcohol can make falling asleep easier, this effect only lasts a few hours. As the alcohol starts to wear off, it will actually be harder to stay asleep or sleep restfully.</li>
          </uL>
          <p><br><strong>Is there anything I should be doing when I wake in the mornings?</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Morning is the time for both the body and the mind to wake up. In the morning, light filtering into the bedroom should be increased. Bright light tells your brain it's time to wake up!</li>
          </ul>
          <p><br><strong>Should I get up at the same time every day?</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Yes. You should go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Research shows that it’s best to wake up at the same time everyday, even on weekends.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><br><strong>Here are some daytime suggestions to make it easier to fall and stay asleep at night:</strong></p>
          <p><u>Exercise</u></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Research links regular exercise to healthy sleep patterns because exercise affects your body temperature.</li>
            <li>When you exercise, your body temperature goes up, then drops a few hours later.</li>
            <li>The drop in temperature can help you fall asleep and stay asleep longer.</li>
            <li>Try to exercise three to six hours before bed to give your body time to cool down<br type="_moz">&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p><u>Limit Naps</u></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Limit your naps to 30 minutes or less</li>
            <li>If you’ve taken a long nap earlier in the day, you may find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime</li>
            <li>Short naps (10 to 30 minutes) can improve your mood and alertness</li>
            <li>Napping in the early afternoon, especially after a night of bad sleep, can be a good option</li>
            <li>Set an alarm to keep your nap to 30 minutes or less</li>
          </ul>
          <p><br><u>Don’t eat or drink caffeine in the afternoon or evening</u></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Caffeine in coffee, tea, soda and chocolate may last for hours in your body, interfering with sleep</li>
            <li>Avoid caffeine after lunch</li>
          </ul>

A natural response to such experiences is to feel intense emotional responses, relive the event in thoughts or dreams, and avoid situations that may evoke memories of the event. These responses are often referred to as post-traumatic stress (PTS). For many people, these responses diminish with time, but for others they may continue causing problems with daily life and develop into a chronic psychological condition called posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>There are <u>four</u> main types of combat or Post-Traumatic Stress reactions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Intrusive and unwanted memories of the traumatic event</li>
            <li>Avoidance of reminders of the event</li>
            <li>Negative thoughts and mood</li>
            <li>High physical tension or arousal</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This section of the Post-Traumatic Stress booklet describes these reactions and how to recognize them.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Post-Traumatic Stress: Intrusive and Unwanted Memories</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Service members who have been through stressful events often have repeated, disturbing memories of those events.&nbsp; This is called “re-experiencing.” When your mind tries to make sense of what happened, you may experience upsetting thoughts or dreams.&nbsp; Certain people, places, sounds, or smells can remind you of things that happened while deployed.&nbsp; These reminders are called “triggers.”</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Post-Traumatic Stress: Avoidance Reminders</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>It’s natural to do everything possible to avoid reminders of a past trauma.&nbsp; When you avoid reminders of your deployment, you might...</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stay away from certain people, places, or conversations, for example:<br><ul style="list-style-type:circle;"><li><em>Avoid watching or reading the news</em></li>
            <li><em>Avoid crowds or bridges</em></li>
            <li>Avoid thoughts, feelings or sensations associated with the trauma, for example you might:<br><ul style="list-style-type:circle;"><li><em>Try not to think about the deployment</em></li>
            <li><em>Avoid your feelings and become emotionally numb or distant</em></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Avoidance can seem like a good strategy in the short-term, but it becomes a problem over time.&nbsp; If you avoid trauma reminders, you cannot learn that things are different now.&nbsp; In the meantime, your world becomes smaller and smaller.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Post-Traumatic Stress: Negative Thoughts and Mood</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Changes in thoughts and mood may occur or worsen following a traumatic event.&nbsp; Examples include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Negative evaluation of self, others, and the world</li>
            <li>Elevated self-blame or guilt</li>
            <li>Detachment from others</li>
            <li>Loss of interest</li>
            <li>Decreased positive emotions</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Like avoidance, negative thoughts and moods can worsen if they are not actively challenged and countered.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Post-Traumatic Stress: High Physical Tension or Arousal</h3>
        <p>The fourth type of stress reaction is maintaining a high level of physical tension and alertness all the time, which is sometimes called a “hyper-arousal reaction.”  When a serious life 
        threat occurs, humans are hard wired to be “on-guard” until the threat is over.  You may have trouble falling or staying asleep, feel irritable or angry, have trouble concentrating, or feel 
        like you are always on guard.  If the threat is prolonged, like during deployment, it can be hard for service members to return to a calm state when they return home.  It is possible to 
        practice some simple tools to help your body return to a normal, less tense state.  Sometimes hyper-arousal reactions include impulsive or self-destructive behaviors.  When these behaviors occur, 
        it’s important to seek out help.</p>
        <h3>Post-Traumatic Stress: The Vicious Cycle of Stress Reactions</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Remember, it is natural for service members to experience unwanted memories of a trauma, avoid trauma reminders, and maintain a high level of alertness.&nbsp; However, if you never confront these reactions, you could experience a “vicious cycle” of depression or anxiety; relationship problems; struggles at work; alcohol or substance abuse; and a lower quality of life.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind that the reactions you are experiencing do not mean that you are weak, losing control, or going crazy.</p>
          <p>Some questions to ask yourself:</p>
          <p>·&nbsp;Do the reactions described in this section sound like ones that you have been experiencing?</p>
          <p>·&nbsp;Can you think of specific examples when you experienced an unwanted memory, avoided a trauma reminder, or felt hyper-alert?</p>
          <p>·&nbsp;How have these stress reactions interfered with your life?</p>
          <p>·&nbsp;How have you tried to deal with these stress reactions?&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The more you know about your stress reactions, the better prepared you will be to manage them.&nbsp; You will also be in a better position to explain to others what you are going through, and may find that you are more patient with yourself.&nbsp; Remember: it takes time and effort to recover from deployment stress.&nbsp; The information provided in this chapter can help you make sense of your experience.</p>

      title : '2.0 Post-Traumatic Stress: Understanding Trauma Memories',
      content : `
        <p>After experiencing a traumatic event it’s normal to have repeated thoughts about what happened.  Traumatic events are so shocking and different that they don’t fit well with what you already know about the 
        world.  In order to make sense of what happened, your mind keeps bringing the trauma memory back, replaying it over again when you’re awake or dreaming.  Basically, your mind is trying to digest what happened, 
        fit it in to what you already know, and regain some sense of control.   Unfortunately, you may have very little control over upsetting thoughts about the trauma. This section describes common triggers that can 
        prompt these memories.</p>
        <h3>Post-Traumatic Stress: What Are Trauma Triggers?</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Although it may seem that unwanted thoughts or memories are occurring “out of the blue,” they are actually being triggered by some reminder. They may include sights, sounds, smells, or other sensations. Most people who have experienced a traumatic event are reminded of it in their day-to-day life.</p>
          <p>Reminders of triggers can include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sights</li>
            <li>Sounds</li>
            <li>Smells</li>
            <li>Body Sensations</li>
            <li>Internal Experiences (thoughts, memories or feelings)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Personal reminders of a trauma can easily set off upsetting emotions including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fear</li>
            <li>Anger</li>
            <li>Sadness</li>
            <li>Guilt</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There may also be intense physical reactions, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pounding Heart</li>
            <li>Shortness of Breath</li>
            <li>Sweating</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Whatever was present at the time the trauma was happening may become connected in your mind with the trauma itself.&nbsp; For example, if you were ambushed while driving under a bridge, you may find yourself becoming very upset whenever you approach a highway overpass.&nbsp; Your mind now associates bridges with danger.</p>
          <p>This powerful type of learning helped you survive while you were deployed.&nbsp; You quickly learned the signs that you were in a dangerous situation, which helped you react more quickly.&nbsp; But many of the things that signaled danger in the war zone are harmless back in the civilian world.&nbsp; For example, bridges and overpasses are not typically dangerous in the United States.</p>
          <p>Thinking you are constantly under attack stresses your body and creates strong emotions.&nbsp; If you feel like you are always in danger, you may want to go out less, or avoid certain places or people.&nbsp; It is very important for you to <strong>“</strong>disconnect” these old reminders from the danger circuits of your brain.&nbsp; You can do this by re-training yourself to recognize when you are safe – even if physical, mental, and emotional reactions tell you that you’re in danger.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Post-Traumatic Stress: Common Deployment Triggers</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Every individual who experiences a traumatic event has unique triggers.&nbsp; Input from your five senses, along with the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that you had during the original trauma, can trigger negative reactions long after your deployment. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Trauma triggers are often closely related to the type of trauma experienced.&nbsp; Here are some common deployment experiences and possible triggers.</p>
          <p>Places</p>
          <p>Similar to those in which the trauma occurred</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Crowded places</li>
            <li>Hospitals</li>
            <li>Open-air markets</li>
            <li>Driving on roads</li>
          </ul>
          <p>People</p>
          <p>Who look similar to your attackers</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Language</li>
            <li>Dress</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Sights, Smells, Sounds</p>
          <p>From the time of the trauma</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Open air food markets</li>
            <li>Fireworks</li>
            <li>People speaking in Arabic</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Circumstances</p>
          <p>Similar to those in which the trauma occurred</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Conflict with others</li>
            <li>Driving through an intersection</li>

        <h3>Post-Traumatic Stress: How to Identify Personal Trauma Triggers</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Your brain makes connections between traumatic events and danger, and does so in ways that are sometimes confusing or hard to figure out. For example, if your trauma occurred late at night, you might feel extremely upset any time you are suddenly awakened.&nbsp; Even though the trauma had very little to do with the time of the day, your brain made the connection and so your body reacts as if it is in danger.&nbsp; Not knowing the cause of your reaction can be uncomfortable and frustrating.&nbsp; One of the first steps is to identify your unique triggers so that you can lessen their impact.</p>
          <p>If you know your triggers, you can better recognize <u>when</u> you are being triggered.&nbsp; This can help you react more effectively and calmly.&nbsp; Over time you can break the connection in your brain between the trigger and the unpleasant reactions.&nbsp; The more you learn about your personal triggers, the more you’ll feel in control of how you respond to them.&nbsp; The ultimate goal is for <strong><em>you </em></strong>to control your life, not the triggers.</p>
          <p>Some trauma triggers are easy to identify because they obviously remind you of your traumatic deployment experiences.&nbsp; Other triggers might not be so easy to recognize.&nbsp; Once you begin to discover what situations, objects, people or events are acting as trauma triggers, you will have some insight into what is causing your negative reactions — this is the first step to changing those reactions.&nbsp; It’s also important to ask yourself whether the thoughts and feelings you’re having are based in the past or the present.&nbsp; When you begin slowing down the process in this way, you will begin to reduce the power that triggers have over you.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Post-Traumatic Stress: Keeping a Personal Trauma Trigger Record</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Try keeping a Trigger Record for the next seven days.&nbsp; You can make a personalized Trigger Record by writing down the following observations whenever you think you have experienced a trauma trigger:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The date and time</li>
            <li>A description of the trigger</li>
            <li>The emotions you were feeling</li>
            <li>Your body’s reactions (sweating, nausea, etc)</li>
            <li>The thoughts you were having and what you were telling yourself</li>
            <li>Ways the trigger situation differed from the original traumatic event</li>
            <li>The amount of difficulty you had managing the trigger (on a scale from 1 to 10)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Use the Trigger Record <em>as soon as possible</em> each time you are triggered.&nbsp; It is important that you recognize what triggered you.&nbsp; It is also important to see how the trigger affected your emotions, physical reactions, and behaviors.&nbsp; You will begin to see how trauma triggers are different from the original traumatic experience.&nbsp; If you have strong feelings or sensations, you can start from there and work backwards to determine the trigger that set you off.</p>

      title : '3.0 Post-Traumatic Stress: Tools for Managing Stress Reactions',
      content : `
        <p>Most service members who have experienced traumatic events are triggered at least once in a while.  It’s important to practice good coping skills.  Whether you are triggered by something you know 
        or by something unexpected, there are tools you can use to reduce the emotional and physical impact. This section describes some of these tools and how and when to use them.</p>
        <h3>Post-Traumatic Stress: Using the RID Tool</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>The RID Tool is a three-step skill you can use when triggered to help “RID” yourself of negative reactions to triggers.</p>
          <p>RID stands for <span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Relax</strong></span>, <span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Identify</strong></span> the trigger,<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong> Decide</strong></span> your response.</p>
          <p>STEP 1:&nbsp; RELAX</p>
          <p>Here are a few things to help you relax when you have been triggered:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Take a few deep breaths or use other brief relaxation exercises.</li>
            <li>Tell yourself something calming or reassuring, like “This too shall pass,” or “I’m not in danger now,” or “the trauma is not happening again.”</li>
            <li>Take a moment to calm down.&nbsp; Get a drink of water or walk to the restroom and splash cool water on your face.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>STEP 2:&nbsp; IDENTIFY YOUR TRIGGER</p>
          <p>Once you are relaxed, try identifying what factors may have caused a trigger by asking yourself:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“What is triggering me?”</li>
            <li>“What unsettled me?”</li>
            <li>“Did I accidentally walk into one of my known triggers?”</li>
            <li>“What is it about <em>this </em>situation that is like my deployment?”</li>
          </ul><p>It is important to recognize that the current trigger is different from your trauma.&nbsp; This helps you to see that you are not in danger and can also help you regain a sense of control or safety.</p>
          <p>For example, &nbsp;“I was triggered by this van because the one that I saw explode was also white.&nbsp; But the van that exploded was smaller and foreign made.&nbsp; The explosion happened in a war zone, while this is just a U.S. highway.”</p>
          <p>Sometimes it is hard to pinpoint your trigger.&nbsp; If you can’t identify it, don’t worry.&nbsp; Work on relaxing and calming yourself.</p>
          <p>STEP 3:&nbsp; DECIDE YOUR RESPONSE</p>
          <p>Deciding how to respond to a situation can help you feel more in control.&nbsp; Try these suggestions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Go back to what you were doing before the trigger</li>
            <li>Start a conversation with someone around you</li>
            <li>Excuse yourself from situations in which you feel angry</li>
            <li>Seek support from someone you trust</li>
            <li>Focus on sights and sounds around you</li>
            <li>Find a positive distraction that will hold your attention, like going for a walk</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Post-Traumatic Stress: Staying Present in the Situation</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>If your trigger makes you feel fearful or anxious, you may want to leave the situation as soon as possible.&nbsp; But it is important to stay in the situation and 
          face your fear.&nbsp; If you let yourself feel painful emotions without backing away, the power of the trigger will weaken over time.</p>
          <p>Remember, don’t leave the situation until you feel the trigger is less powerful than when you first confronted it.&nbsp; If you run away from your trigger 
          by immediately leaving the situation, you won’t learn the trigger is not dangerous.&nbsp; If you continue to avoid your triggers, they may become more difficult to confront and overcome.&nbsp; 
          But if you face your triggers, they will gradually weaken and you will feel less distress.</p>
          <p align="left">TALKING YOURSELF THROUGH A SITUATION</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I’m okay and safe in this situation</li>
            <li>My trauma happened in the past</li>
            <li>My thoughts and feelings are uncomfortable, but they can’t harm me</li>
            <li>These feelings won’t last forever</li>
            <li>These feelings will gradually become less powerful</li>
            <li>If I can tolerate these feelings for one minute, I can<br>tolerate them for one <em>more </em>minute</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
          <p>If the trigger makes you angry and you believe staying in the situation may cause you to act in a way you’ll regret, remove yourself from the situation and cool off.&nbsp; Try some relaxation tools (e.g., a ‘time out’ or a ‘cool down’), or find someone you trust and talk things out.&nbsp; When you have cooled down, you can return to the situation if you choose.&nbsp; 
          If you choose to stay in the situation remember that your judgment may be impaired by your arousal.&nbsp; Try to stay calm, communicate effectively, and be flexible.</p>
          <p align="left">WHAT TO DO AFTER A TRIGGER EVENT IS OVER</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Avoid harsh judgments or criticisms of the way you handled the trigger.</li>
            <li>Treat yourself like a loved one or a close friend going through the same thing.</li>
            <li>See the trigger as a learning experience, regardless of outcome.</li>
            <li>Complete your TRIGGER RECORD.&nbsp; Review what went well and where to improve.</li>
            <li>Talk about the trigger event with a close friend or loved one.</li>
            <li>Remind yourself that, with time and practice, triggers get easier to handle.</li>
            <li>Prevent your triggers from limiting your freedom or keeping you from activities that make your life fulfilling or meaningful.</li>
            <li>Reward yourself for successfully managing your triggers.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Post-Traumatic Stress: The PLAN Tool</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>Use the PLAN tool when you know the situation will be triggering or stressful.&nbsp; There are four steps to PLAN:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>P</strong>repare for the situation</li>
            <li><strong>L</strong>et go of your worry</li>
            <li><strong>A</strong>ccept that you will experience distress and that you can manage your reaction</li>
            <li><strong>N</strong>ote all of your coping skills and helpful resources</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>STEP 1: </strong><strong>P</strong>repare for the situation.</p>
          <p>Think about the upcoming situation and how to handle it.&nbsp; If possible, talk about it with someone whose judgment you respect and ask yourself:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“Can I relax before the situation?”</li>
            <li>“Would it help to take along a friend who knows what I might experience?”</li>
            <li>“Can I change the situation, or make a plan to make it easier to deal with?”</li>
            <li>What exactly sets me off in <em>this</em> situation?”</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>STEP 2: </strong><strong>L</strong>et go of your worry.</p>
          <p>It’s good to know beforehand when you will face a trigger.&nbsp; Worrying how you will react to a situation can be worse than the situation itself.&nbsp; To let go of your worry:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ask yourself, “Are my worries reasonable or excessive?”</li>
            <li>Tell yourself, “Just because I can think it, does not mean it will happen.”</li>
            <li>Ask yourself, “What exactly is scaring me?”</li>
            <li>Ask yourself, “Are my fears reasonable?”</li>
            <li>Tell yourself, “I’ve prepared for the situation and that’s the best I can do.”</li>
            <li>If you start to worry, try to focus on a positive activity.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>STEP 3: </strong><strong>A</strong>ccept that you will experience distress and that you can manage your reaction.</p>
          <p>Even normal stress can become more difficult to manage after a trauma.&nbsp; Accepting that you will experience negative feelings can help you because:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>It means you have realistic expectations about your reactions.</li>
            <li>Accepting does not mean feeling good about being upset.</li>
            <li>It can help you to cope with situations better.</li>
            <li>You won’t allow negative feelings to control your life.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>STEP 4: </strong><strong>N</strong>ote all of your coping skills and helpful resources.&nbsp; Think of all the skills you have learned for managing stressful situations.&nbsp; Tell yourself: “During stressful situations, I can…”</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Have a friend or loved one with me.</li>
            <li>Practice relaxation exercises.</li>
            <li>Say positive things to myself.</li>
            <li>Use positive strategies that worked on my triggers in the past.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Post-Traumatic Stress: Do's and Don'ts of Coping with Trauma Triggers</h3>
        <div class="field-item even">
          <p>To strengthen your coping skills, you should recognize behaviors and thoughts that may be interfering with coping.&nbsp; Review these <em>Do’s and Don’ts</em>.</p>
          <p><strong>Trauma Trigger Do’s</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Relax: </strong>Listen to music, sit in nature, say a prayer, take a hot bath, get a massage, or do whatever relaxes you.</li>
            <li><strong>Exercise: </strong>Maintain a daily exercise routine.&nbsp; Regular exercise helps fight depression and reduces physical tension.&nbsp; Or use the ‘Health &amp; Wellness’ workshop.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Connected: </strong>Resist the urge to be alone.&nbsp; Make plans, commit, and follow through with getting together with family and friends — they provide support and comfort you need to recover.</li>
            <li><strong>Mind Your Habits: </strong>Limit harmful behaviors, like isolating socially, drinking excessively, using drugs, driving fast, overeating or hurting yourself to avoid emotional pain.</li>
            <li><strong>Create a Routine: </strong>Develop and maintain a routine for eating, sleeping, and exercising.&nbsp; Create a schedule that keeps you active and involved in things you value.&nbsp; A routine can carry you through the tough periods, helping you manage times of high stress.</li>
            <li><strong>Take a Break From Feeling Bad: </strong>Limit the amount of time you allow yourself to feel bad.&nbsp; If you start to worry, put it off until a time you’ve scheduled just for that purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Be a Friend to Yourself: </strong>Go easy on yourself.&nbsp; Imagine how you would treat a friend in a similar experience.&nbsp; Take time to grieve your losses.&nbsp; Remind yourself that things will get better.</li>
            <li><strong>Have Some Fun, Allow Yourself to Feel Good:&nbsp; </strong>Take care of yourself by finding pleasant and healthy activities.&nbsp; Often trauma survivors don’t think they are allowed to feel good or heal.&nbsp; You may feel guilty, embarrassed or ashamed but positive emotions help you overcome the challenges of recovery.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Trauma Trigger Don’ts</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Excessive avoidance of reminders:</strong> Avoiding situations and reminders can bring some temporary relief but it does not allow new associations and reactions to develop.&nbsp; Encourage yourself to face what you may be avoiding.</li>
            <li><strong>Excessive avoidance of memories:</strong> The more you try not to think about something, the harder it is to let go of the thought. Resisting a thought actually increases the chance of you thinking about it. Instead, try to face what you may be avoiding.</li>
            <li><strong>Dwelling on memories:</strong> Spending too much time going over the event in your mind and&nbsp; wishing things turned out differently or second guessing yourself can be very unproductive.</li>
            <li><strong>Alcohol and drug use:</strong> Engaging in heavy drinking and drug use lengthens the natural recovery process and can lead to substance abuse.&nbsp; If alcohol or drug use is causing problems in your life, seek counseling by using the “Locate” tab on this website for assistance locating a provider near you.&nbsp; You are also encouraged to participate in the ‘Alcohol and Drugs’ workshop.</li>
            <li><strong>Excessive anger:</strong> Property destruction and violence against others are clear signs your anger is out of control and it’s time to speak with a professional.&nbsp; Another resource is the ’Anger’ Workshop.</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional numbing:</strong> A common reaction to traumatic stress is to automatically turn down the intensity of feelings and dull your negative <em>and </em>positive emotions.&nbsp; As you confront triggers and experience uncomfortable emotions, you may begin to notice the return of positive emotions as well.</li>
            <li><strong>Excessive risk-taking:</strong> Engaging in dangerous behavior such as gambling, risky sex, or driving fast may distract momentarily, but they disrupt the natural recovery process.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Self-Harm:</strong>&nbsp; If you’re having thoughts about hurting yourself, there are people to help you.&nbsp; Speak to a health care professional 24/7 by calling the Military Crisis Line 800-273-8255 or text 838255. If you or a loved one needs immediate help, call <strong>9-1-1</strong>.</p>
